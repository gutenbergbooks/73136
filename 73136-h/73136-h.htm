<h2 class="main">PREFACE</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">These stories, told by and about the Indians, have been gathered from various sources.
They show, among other interesting facts, that the love of the beautiful, and also
of the humorous, dwells in the heart of the wild Indian.
</p>
<p>There are no adaptations from Longfellow’s poem of <i>Hiawatha</i>, but the compiler has gone directly to the works of Schoolcraft, whose writings were
Longfellow’s inspiration. Schoolcraft’s <i>Journal</i> states his belief that Menabozho and Hiawatha were one and the same person, the latter
name being preferred as more musical. Hence, Longfellow chose it as the name of his
Indian hero.
</p>
<p>Horatio Hale and other authorities on Iroquois history differ strongly from Schoolcraft
on this point, and maintain that the name of Hiawatha, or Heyanwatha, refers only
to an Iroquois statesman or deity.
</p>
<p>Menabozho, or The Foolish One, is very real to the Chippewa or Ojibway Indian of Minnesota.
The various <span class="pageNum" id="pb.iv">[<a href="#pb.iv">iv</a>]</span>names of Missaba, Mesaba, Michabo are merely English or French renderings of the same
Algonquin word.
</p>
<p>The later stories herein told, that were gathered from the Chippewas in 1895, 1896,
and 1900, prove their unchanging love for the tales of this imaginary hero.
</p>
<p>Attention is called to the very interesting pictures on pages 17, 43, 53, 55, 89,
100, 173, and 188, which are from photographs taken by George Wharton James, of Pasadena,
Cal., the noted authority upon Indian life and basketry. The copyrighted pictures
on pages 43 and 55 are used in this book with his special permission.
</p>
<p>In addition to the numerous illustrations from photographs, Miss Angel de Cora, a
young Indian artist of great promise, has contributed three full-page sketches, the
cover design, and numerous initials and designs. The pictorial features, therefore,
reproduce with unusual fidelity the atmosphere of Indian life.

<p><span class="sc">Note.</span> In answer to inquiries the compiler desires to state that according to the census
reports of 1900 there are fifteen American cities any one of which contains more inhabitants
than the total number, 266,760, of our taxed and untaxed American Indians; of these
nearly one half are in Indian Territory, Alaska, and Arizona.

<p class="first">ohn Eliot, of Massachusetts, published the first Indian Bible. This and other Bibles
and books in the Indian languages may be seen in the larger city libraries.
</p>
<p>The Indians had no printed languages with letters before the white man came; their
painted or carved picture-writing meant much to them. Their teepees were covered with
histories of the battles their owners had fought, but they had no books of “talking
leaves.”
</p>
<p>Se-quoyah, a Georgia Indian half-breed, was a modern Cadmus to his people. He invented
a perfect alphabet of over eighty letters for his native Cherokee language, and by
his own zeal inspired his nation with a love for written words. His paper was birch
bark; his ink the juices of berries and weeds.
<span class="pageNum" id="pb4">[<a href="#pb4">4</a>]</span></p>
<p>He hated the white people, for his white father had basely deserted his mother when
Se-quoyah was a helpless babe. His mother’s father was a proud chief, and the grandson
seems to have inherited his spirit.
</p>
<p>Se-quoyah never learned to read or to write a word or a letter of English, and his
anger was aroused when he saw one of his tribe reading a book made by the hated white
people; Se-quoyah then declared he would make as good a one for the Cherokees, and
he did.
</p>
<p>He listened for sounds while his people talked. He became a silent student and lost
or forgot his old warlike spirit. He sat beside his doorway and marked upon bark.
His people pitied him, for he did not fight. At last he called a council; he wrote
on bark and gave the writing to his little daughter, who had been taught by him to
read. She read it and did as the writing commanded; the test was tried many times.
</p>
<p>This caused great excitement; young men came in scores to learn of him; they forgot
hunting and war for letter-writing. The white missionaries adopted his letters and
made a Bible which was read by all these Indian students. The nation became civilized
in a short time, and the first printing press sent to an Indian tribe was that sent
about 1820 by the United States government to the Cherokees. The type was cast in
Cherokee characters, the same that Se-quoyah had invented.
<span class="pageNum" id="pb5">[<a href="#pb5">5</a>]</span></p>
<p>A marble bust of Se-quoyah adorns the council house in Tahlequah, the capital of Indian
Territory, where this tribe was sent after gold was found on their reservation in
Georgia. They knew the value of these mines, but the white man’s power was stronger
than theirs, and they had to leave homes and wealth for a strange new land.
</p>
<p>Sequoia, the botanical name of the big trees of California, is the only memorial the
white man has given this truly American genius.

</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The Indians made and still make excellent canoes of bark or of logs and even of skins.
The birch-bark canoe is light and very swift, and white hunters are proud of their
skill in its use, but the skin boat has only strength as its merit.
</p>
<p>The Siwash Indian of Puget Sound hollows out from a single log a fine canoe with decorated
prow. He makes it secretly in the dark forest, and white men have tried for years
to solve the problem of its swiftness.
</p>
<p>The bows of strong wood bent by sinew cords and the stone-headed arrows with feather
tips were excellent weapons in the Indians’ former methods of warfare and hunting,
and a good arrowhead maker was famous throughout a nation.

</div><p>
</p>
<p>Indian squaws were skillful in the making of buckskin suits for their braves. The
handsomely embroidered moccasins were and are now good specimens of <span class="pageNum" id="pb8">[<a href="#pb8">8</a>]</span>woman’s work and love for beauty of coloring and design. Each tribe had its own pattern
and shape, differing so much from those of other tribes that a footprint might announce
an enemy in war time.
</p>
<p>The Indians are still noted trappers, and their squaws know well how to tan and dress
the skins of animals. Fish-hooks were made of bone or flint, and spear points were
of the same materials, but they were very sharp and with them the Indians caught many
fish.
</p>
<p>Their roving habits as hunters gave them little time for house-building, and so their
homes were simply tents made of strips of bark or, better yet, of large buffalo or
deer hides, neatly sewed together for this purpose. These teepees and wigwams were
easily put up or removed, and were a good shelter.
</p>
<p>The Village Indians, or Pueblos of Arizona, still build themselves houses of adobe
or unburnt brick. As the Pueblos were and are now less warlike than the roving tribes
which live in tent-like houses, they have had time to invent many useful things.
</p>
<p>The Pueblos weave excellent woolen blankets of gay stripes and a coarse cloth for
wearing apparel. They make water-tight baskets and dishes of fiber, and these are
often exchanged with the Tent Indians for dried meat and other food.
</p>
<p>The Village Indians have for centuries planted and cared for maize, pumpkins, beans,
and other vegetables. <span class="pageNum" id="pb9">[<a href="#pb9">9</a>]</span>Turkeys are raised for food, and their feather fibers are woven into cloth. Eagles
are caged and raised for their long feathers, which are held sacred.
</p>
<p>In the ruined houses of the cliff-dwellers of Texas and Arizona fragments of cloth
woven from cotton and other substances have been found. No white man taught this ancient
people these arts of weaving.
</p>
<p>Clay dishes, mortars, and pestles of stone, large sea-shells cut into shapes for holding
food, stone axes, and knives show some of the skill of these early Americans.
</p>
<p>The ornaments made of silver by the Navajo, as well as the long strings of turquoise
beads, are sometimes remarkable for their beauty.
</p>
<p>Wampum, used by so many tribes for money, was carefully made from shells by eastern
Indians. It seems strange that their crude tools could have made such small beads
so very well.
</p>
<p>The knowledge of medicine in all tribes was limited to a few herbs. The rest was a
kind of sorcery; but with the herbs, fresh air, and fresh water they managed to cure
many ills.
</p>
<p>The Pueblos of New Mexico are very different from the Zuñis or the Moki Pueblos of
Arizona. They are now much like the white people, for they live in well-built houses,
attend church, and send their children to school.

<h2 class="main">HOW THE IROQUOIS BUILT THEIR LOG FORTS</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first"></p>
<div class="figure floatLeft"><img src="images/it010.png" alt="T" width="228" height="226"></div>
<p class="first">he French explorers in the land near Lake Champlain, and in what is now central New
York, found many of the Iroquois villages protected by strong, well-built log forts.
</p>
<p>They were built in this way: The Indians first found a place where there were many
tall trees; these were set on fire near their roots, and stone axes were used to rub
off the coals, so they would burn faster. After the trees had fallen to the ground
they were set on fire again, in places about three long steps apart. The fires burned
through the logs in about half a day.
</p>
<p>As there were no horses, the logs were drawn by the Indians, and then put into place.
Earth was heaped up on both sides of the logs to keep them from falling. The forts
had two gates; the one in front for general use; the one in the rear for use when
getting water.
</p>
<p>In making the fire to burn the logs, a small dry stick was quickly rubbed with a steady
motion against <span class="pageNum" id="pb11">[<a href="#pb11">11</a>]</span>well-seasoned wood; after a while it would burn. Great care was used in preserving
coals of fire through the night time for the next day’s use.
</p>
<p>On the shores of the beautiful Seneca Lake, by the banks of the Mohawk and Genesee
rivers, in the forests of Oneida and Cayuga, and in many other parts of this fertile
region, these strongholds of a savage people stood secure.
</p>
<p>Sometimes several acres of land were enclosed, with many homes well protected both
day and night from wild animals and other foes.
</p>
<p>Some of these rude dwellings were more than one hundred feet in length, and were made
of poles bent like an arch and covered closely with many layers of elm bark. These
large houses, thus protected by forts, were used by several different families, for
the “long-houses” were divided into rooms by deerskins or other robes.
</p>
<p>Fine fields of corn, squashes, and beans were planted and harvested by these fort
dwellers, and they knew well how to protect themselves from intruders, for they had
hundreds of stones and even huge rocks piled inside the fort ready to hurl at an enemy.

<div class="divBody">
<div class="figure floatLeft"><img src="images/it012.png" alt="T" width="206" height="298"></div>
<p class="first">he Leni Lennape, or Delaware Indians, kept a curious record of their early history
by means of sticks which were notched and painted; these sticks were about six inches
long. Each painted notch indicated some great event in their nation’s history. The
meanings of the notches were taught by old chiefs to the younger ones, and the stories
have been repeated for hundreds of years. Leni Lennape means <i>Men of Men</i> or <i>The People</i>, and these sticks have been held to prove that their nation is one of the oldest
among the red men. Their chiefs were noted for their wisdom in war and peace.
</p>
<p>A white man, who proved himself a true friend to the Leni Lennapes, gained their confidence
and they told him the secrets that were kept by the painted sticks. He had it printed,
but had to leave out many words, as their language is very different from English.
It is an easy matter to read the history now, and, although many words are omitted,
any one can understand its meaning.
<span class="pageNum" id="pb13">[<a href="#pb13">13</a>]</span></p>
<p>This record, which the notched and painted sticks have kept for several hundreds of
years, is an account of the travels of the Leni Lennape Indians from the Northwest
across the Wide River. This must have been the Mississippi. They call it Namesi Sipu,
the “river of fish.”
</p>
<p>When across the Wide River, they found they had come to the country of the Great Serpent.
Numerous earth mounds in the form of an immense serpent are found in the valley of
the Mississippi. These are believed to have been made by a people, long ago extinct,
who may have fought the Delawares.
</p>
<p>Other Indian tribes and nations have kept long records by means of similar sticks,
but the account given by this people is the longest Indian history. The last marks
upon these painted sticks are said to mean: “The white men have come from the north
and the south. They are peaceful; they have great things. Who are they?”
</p>
<p>These Leni Lennapes are the Delawares, with whom the Quakers made their treaty near
Philadelphia. The Iroquois had conquered these Indians, and had refused to let them
go to war as a punishment for their great bravery. The Quakers found them peaceable,
honest, and faithful friends, and for forty years no white person was harmed who had
never broken his promise to the Leni Lennapes, or Delaware Indians.
<span class="pageNum" id="pb14">[<a href="#pb14">14</a>]</span></p>
<p>The Aztecs, or Mexican Indians, had a serpent god, and some have said that these mounds
must have been built by them. The Leni Lennape stick records tell only that the country
of the Great Serpent was conquered little by little. The mounds are themselves the
unsolved records of a great people. No Indian legends or histories have ever explained
the meaning of these heaps of earth, which are shaped like animals or birds, and are
now sometimes covered by huge trees.
</p>
<p>The wampum belt tells its story by the pictures upon it, while the record sticks had
only painted notches to help the memory of the tribe’s historians.

<h2 class="main">WAMPUM MONEY</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Wampum has been used among the Indians east of the Rocky Mountains since the whites
first had dealings with them. Among the eastern Indians it was first found to be made
of the white and purple parts of clam shells. These shells were carefully cut into
small pieces by means of sharp-edged stone knives, and a hole was bored through the
pieces, making them like little tubes.
</p>
<p>The white and the dark-colored beads were threaded and carefully arranged into patterns
when belts or other woven pieces of ornament were made. The threads were either of
vegetable fiber or of deer sinews, and long strings were sometimes made of the bark
of the slippery-elm tree. Dark-colored parts of the shells from which the beads were
made were called black, but they were really dark shades of purple. White beads meant
peace. Dark beads were woven into the belt either in square or diamond patterns or
in some more irregular shape.
<span class="pageNum" id="pb16">[<a href="#pb16">16</a>]</span></p>
<p>The wampum belt used in the treaty between William Penn and the Indians is now in
the rooms of the Pennsylvania Historical Society. It was given to this society by
a great-grandson of William Penn. This wampum belt was given to its first white owner
as a solemn token that they would keep their pledge. History has shown how faithfully
these red men kept their pledge with the Quakers.
</p>
<p>This famous belt is an unusually wide one, having eighteen rows of wampum and nearly
three thousand beads, which is proof that it was an important token. The center of
the belt is of white wampum with two figures of men wrought in dark beads. The figures
are pictured as clasping each other’s hands. One man pictured on the belt wears a
hat, while the other does not; this shows that one was a white man, the other an Indian.
</p>
<p>This belt was kept in the Penn family and treasured with as much care as the chain
and medal given to William Penn by the English Parliament; indeed, the medal and the
wampum belt each served a like purpose: they were reminders of the promises of a nation.
</p>
<p>Wampum belts of great historic value are kept by the Onondaga Indians; the finest
of these is called the George Washington belt. It is believed by those who have had
charge of it to be a pledge relating to a treaty between the early government of the
United States and the Six Nations. Fifteen men are pictured on this belt. <span class="pageNum" id="pb18">[<a href="#pb18">18</a>]</span>These may mean the original thirteen colonies and the people who were the speakers
at the time of the treaty.

</p>
<p>Such uses of belts of wampum were common among the different tribes of Indians. Smaller
belts were woven for the chiefs to wear, and the women made themselves bracelets and
neck chains of the beads.
</p>
<p>It was necessary for the whites in the very early times to have this Indian money
ready when they wished to purchase furs or other supplies of their wild neighbors.
The beads had a certain value according to the number of strings. This value never
changed.
</p>
<p>It is told by the people who wrote back to England in those early days that the Indians
could not be made to understand why they should pay more wampum for anything when
it was scarce than when it was plentiful. They were used to having one price for things
they wished to buy and never having the price changed. For this reason the early settlers
were able to buy many valuable things at a very small price.
</p>
<p>The chiefs of the Iroquois, while mourning a chief’s death, wore strings of black
wampum. Other strings of different lengths or colors meant various things to the owners
and those about them. The wearing of wampum in any quantity meant wealth and position.
</p>
<p>It is told of the famous Chief Logan that he saved a captive white by rushing through
the circle of Indians <span class="pageNum" id="pb19">[<a href="#pb19">19</a>]</span>who were tormenting him, and throwing a string of wampum about the captive’s neck.
From that minute he belonged to Chief Logan.
</p>
<p>Wampum has been made by machinery since 1670 and sold to the Indians. Old belts and
strings of beads, so slowly made by hand, are very valuable. The white and colored
glass beads now used are worth but little compared with the wampum of early days.

<p class="first">lmost unconsciously, even as our own eyes and other senses are trained to help us
in city or country life, the Indians are adding to their education in the things which
will make life and labor easier to them. Their reading of weather signs is very accurate,
and possibly their rain-makers are simply experts in these signs.
</p>
<p>Their method of lying in ambush in war times calls out all their hidden powers in
every line. They can decoy their foe by imitating bird calls or animals; they can
make themselves into stump-like figures and almost defy a close inspection.
</p>
<p>If injured, they rarely show pain, though the torture of the broken limb or the bullet
may be intense. Indian boys are taught by both parents from early childhood to bear
their pain silently. It comes as a good lesson, when in manhood a groan might show
an enemy where they were hidden.
</p>
<p>Their long trails or paths over mountains, through thick forests, across treeless
plains, with no compass <span class="pageNum" id="pb21">[<a href="#pb21">21</a>]</span>but the North Star, have made them watchful of every earthly means of finding their
way. They will tell you that trees are greener on the south side than on the north,
and that there are plants whose leaves point due north. Flocks of birds sometimes
help to guide them. They seem to have almost an instinct in finding their way home.
</p>
<p>An Indian’s natural pride is as great as a king’s. To him his nation is the greatest
one on earth. No Indian must allow that the white is greater in numbers or strength.
</p>
<p>A number of years ago a Mandan chief named Ietan visited the city of Washington in
company with others. On his return, at the council which was called in his honor,
he told of boats he had seen that were one hundred and fifty feet long; of great houses
filled with white people; of great cities and long railroad trails.
</p>
<p>The Indians will have nothing but absolute truth at these councils. They must not
deceive each other. The council declared that Ietan was telling false tales to frighten
the Mandans. No canoe could be built so large as he had said. No such number of white
people could live in a land where there were no buffalo. Houses such as he had told
about would be blown down by the great winds.
</p>
<p>Ietan was proven to have basely deceived the council. He was condemned to death for
making the <span class="pageNum" id="pb22">[<a href="#pb22">22</a>]</span>white man stronger and greater than the red man. Ietan told them he was ready and
willing to suffer the penalty, but when they were older they would know that his words
were not false. He was punished as the council decreed. Perhaps they are wise enough
now to read the signs made by the iron trails across the Dakota prairies, and their
children know that what Ietan said was true.
</p>
<p>Indians seem to have great pity for the unfortunate few of their tribe who have lost
their senses, becoming either insane or foolish. A certain professor belonging to
a well-known eastern college had reason to be thankful for this trait not many years
ago. He had been gathering plants and insects in one of the desolate regions in the
west. He was unarmed, and knew nothing of any Indian language or of the sign language
so much used west of the Mississippi.
</p>
<p>A marauding band of Indians caught sight of him. Wheeling their ponies in his direction,
they were down upon him before he had time to do anything more than gather his collection
into the boxes and get upon his pony. For some reason they did not offer to hurt him;
they, however, were willing to make themselves richer by whatever they could get from
him. The professor did not say a word, but handed them his case of roots and plants.
At this they stared open-eyed, for it contained nothing that any one could eat. His
boxes of <span class="pageNum" id="pb24">[<a href="#pb24">24</a>]</span>insects were next examined. Nothing of use to them was found. His pockets were searched.
They were filled with bugs, flies, and flower specimens.
</p>
<div class="figure p023width" id="p023"><img src="images/p023.jpg" alt="Hogan of Navajo Blanket Weaver" width="662" height="476"><p class="figureHead"><span class="sc">Hogan of Navajo Blanket Weaver</span></p>
<p class="first">From a Photograph</p>
</div><p>
</p>
<p>Looking him over from head to foot, they all seem to have reached the same conclusion
at the same time; with shouts of laughter and mocking bows and grimaces, they gave
him back his boxes. They had discovered by all the signs that he was a being who had
not a sense left, and they would not harm him. So the learned professor was spared
to return to tell the tale.
</p>
<p>The numerous Indian nations of America are and were as different in their character
and conditions as are the civilized people living in America to-day. They had their
unions and their divisions of land according to nation, not according to family or
person. Many nations seem to have had wise laws.
</p>
<p>Very strangely, many of the tribes expected the coming of the white man. When the
Indian has learned that village life is no disgrace, he may become even greater than
the paleface with the talking leaves or printed book.
</p>
<p>A wise old Indian was once told that white men were beginning to think they had found
where the Indian came from; that the place was northern China.
</p>
<p>“Perhaps the people of northern China came from the Indian race in America,” said
the Indian. It was well said. There are many proofs that the mound-builders, <span class="pageNum" id="pb25">[<a href="#pb25">25</a>]</span>the Aztec, and the Indian have made this part of the world their home for ages, when
it was unknown and unthought of in the wildest dreams of seamen or of kings.
</p>
<p>The hunting chase is the great happiness of the Indian. Now the wild buffalo is gone
from the plains forever; the red deer, elk, moose, and bear hide away in the northern
forests; the Indian’s hope for a long future for his nation is lost. They are no longer
braves but squaws, for they must plant corn and watch it. Village life is very tame
compared with the wandering life when the tribes moved to some new place almost every
moon.
</p>
<p>They have an old, old prophecy among many tribes, “that the Great Manitou will some
day send away the white race; the whole earth shall be given to the Indians.” This
prophecy is repeated in the religious dances, and the medicine men comfort their people
with it when the tribes feel the injustice of the whites. It excites them to battle
with the invader.
</p>
<p>Their training has always been for revenge, but they are also trained to remember
the good which has been done to them.

<p class="first">n Indian left his lodge for several days; when he came back, the dried deer meat which
he had left hanging to a tree near his wigwam was gone. He did not go around asking
questions of his neighbors, but just used his eyes instead of his tongue for the first
hour, and his eyes told him many things.
</p>
<p>Then he went to a wigwam near by and asked: “Did you see a little, old, white man
with a short gun? Did you see him in the last two days? Did he have a small dog with
a short tail?”
</p>
<p>The neighbor Indian said: “Yes, I saw him. He and his dog were on the trail going
south.”
</p>
<p>The Indian took the same trail and in a few days returned with the dog and the deer
meat.
</p>
<p>Some white men had heard the questions of the Indian before he started out, and after
he came back they went to him and said: “We want to know who took your meat. How did
you know it was a white man?”
<span class="pageNum" id="pb27">[<a href="#pb27">27</a>]</span></p>
<p>“White man turns toe out; Indian put foot so, one behind the other, walk straight.”
</p>
<p>“How did you know that he was little and that he was old?”
</p>
<p>“He put pile of stones by deer-meat tree; cannot reach, he little. He takes short
steps; he old.”
</p>
<p>“How did you know that his gun was short?”
</p>
<p>“He stick gun on ground against tree. Gun muzzle make mark little way from ground.
Short gun.”
</p>
<p>“Well, how did you ever know that he had a little dog like that, with a short tail?”
</p>
<p>“Dog sit in the sand. Watch man get meat. Dog leave mark where he sit down in sand.

<p class="first">early all tribes have their medicine men. These men choose this work, frequently because
of some deformity which unfits them for the warpath, and they fit themselves for it,
sometimes from boyhood. They have great power over all their people. They are called
into the council when the tribe goes to war. They are called upon when any one is
sick. They believe and teach that sickness is caused by an evil spirit. Their medicine
is to contrive some way to drive out the evil spirit of sickness.
</p>
<p>The medicine man usually works himself into a frenzy or even into a fit, and while
in this state his mutterings are taken for advice and followed. The patient must then
get well. If he does not, it is because the evil spirit cannot be conquered.
</p>
<div class="figure p029width" id="p029"><img src="images/p029.jpg" alt="Big Medicine Man" width="475" height="708"><p class="figureHead"><span class="sc">Big Medicine Man</span></p>

</div><p>
</p>
<p>Many tribes believe that the soul leaves the body when the evil spirit of sickness
enters. The Portage Indians of British America hold this belief. Their medicine men
try to bring back the wandering soul by <span class="pageNum" id="pb30">[<a href="#pb30">30</a>]</span>many curious performances. For one thing, the sick man’s friends are ordered to hang
up his buckskin moccasins stuffed with soft feathery down. If the feathers become
warm to the touch, they will know that the wandering soul has touched them and perhaps
is hiding in them. The moccasins are quickly put upon the feet of the patient that
his soul may not escape. If he does not get well, it is because his friends were not
quick enough in their work.
</p>
<p>The medicine men of many tribes dress themselves in hideous fashion to excite the
fear and compel the respect of their people. They do not have to go on the warpath,
but will do it sometimes. It seems to be a good chance for the deformed to win respect
from the physically perfect.

</p>
<p>An Indian in his native costume is a subject artists are glad to paint,—tanned buckskin
trousers with the buckskin fringe down the outside seams; buckskin moccasins with
colored porcupine quills neatly woven into the leather in regular patterns, and a
heavy blanket or buffalo robe over his shoulders, hanging nearly to the ground. But
the paint upon his face is his chief pride.
</p>
<p>A traveler, in 1835, was taking a trip up the Mississippi. He espied an Indian on
the forward deck who was making his toilet, apparently unaware that a paleface was
watching the process.
</p>
<p>The traveler gives this account: “The Indian had secured at Fort Snelling, near St.
Paul, a bit of broken looking-glass, and there he sat on deck, painting his face and
neck. A daub of the brightest red paint went down the line marking the parting of
his hair.
<span class="pageNum" id="pb32">[<a href="#pb32">32</a>]</span></p>
<p>“He worried and worked as much over the daubs on his cheeks as some very civilized
girls would over a naughty curl. First, a daub of yellow with red at the edge; then
red on the yellow, and yellow on the red, until his eye was satisfied.
</p>
<p>“In the tuft of hair on his crown he stuck an eagle feather; the mirror showed it
was not in a becoming place. Out it came and was poised at a different angle. Still,
it was not just the style he wanted, and out it came again. At last it stood straight
up, and the dandy finished his toilet.
</p>
<p>“Such a self-satisfied air did he put on when paint, feather, and blanket had been
arranged to his liking! Perhaps some daughter of the Dakotas was the cause of all
this patient study of the art of dressing; but I cannot dream of Hiawatha ever belittling
himself to take so long a time with feathers and paint.”
</p>
<p>It seemed strange to the traveler for the Indian to take so much pains with the colors
of paint and the place where he put them upon his face, but it is now known that each
color has its meaning with them. The Indians paint their faces very differently when
they are going on the warpath. The warriors of each nation have their own fashion
of painting their faces and bodies.
</p>
<p>The war chiefs have a very noble look when they come out with their feather war bonnets
reaching from <span class="pageNum" id="pb33">[<a href="#pb33">33</a>]</span>the crowns of their heads down to their feet. Their bearing is dignified; their faces
are earnest and solemn; and each one treads the earth as a king.
</p>
<p>Indian women are sometimes very handsome when young; but the quantity of colored earth
they use as paint does not hide half the dirt upon their faces. They wear blankets
and buckskin skirts, and make a pretty picture if the wigwam is in the background.
Many of the babies have a decidedly Japanese look and are attractive little creatures,
as babies are apt to be.
</p>
<p>The Indian squaw is a good helpmate to her husband. His work is to hunt; her work
is at home in the teepee, where he can find rest and food after his hunting. An Indian
brave will not do his squaw’s work, and his squaw does not wish her brave to be different
from other men.
</p>
<p>The Indian pony seems like a part of the family. He is not petted nor fed like the
Arabian horse, but is just as necessary to his master’s happiness. Indian ponies know
what little food and what no food mean. The rank prairie grass is usually easy for
them to get, but sometimes it is burned off. The pony must search for his own food
in summer or winter.
</p>
<p>The Indian pony or cayuse sometimes carries a load under which a donkey could hardly
move; but he takes his own gait, and keeps it too. He is suited by <span class="pageNum" id="pb34">[<a href="#pb34">34</a>]</span>inherited years of hard work to his master and his home. The Indian pony is thought
to be descended from the horses brought to America by the Spanish explorers.
</p>
<p>The dogs belonging to an Indian camp or village are numerous and often nearly starved.
Whenever a stranger makes his appearance, his coming is announced by furious barks
and howls of these hungry sentinels. The white hunter has reason to dread the attacks
of these dogs, for they are much like the coyotes and wolves of the forests. Unless
his gun is ready, or their masters call them back, it is usually best for the stranger
to find refuge in a tree; but the braves, squaws, and children give the white visitor
a kind welcome as soon as they know that his visit is friendly.

</p>
<p>An Indian, while hunting, followed a bear a long way into the forest. The rain came
and he was lost, so he cut the bark from a tree and made with his tomahawk a picture
of a fox. He put a ring under one foot in the picture. He belonged to the Fox tribe
and had been lost one day. He made more such marks on the trees as he went on.
</p>
<p>Another hunter from the same tribe found him after three days. He had trailed him
by the little marks on the trees; by bent twigs and branches; by his footprints in
the mud or sand. He knew the lost one was very weak and hungry, for the last fox picture
had three circles to show that he had been lost three days, and other marks to show
that he had shot nothing. An untrained white hunter would not have seen one sign of
the lost Indian.
<span class="pageNum" id="pb36">[<a href="#pb36">36</a>]</span></p>
<p>If the Fox Indian had been asked why he used the fox picture, he would have said,
if ready to talk: “My grandfather was a fox.” This would mean to us that his totem
or first ancestor was a fox.
</p>
<p>Other tribes believe they are descended from bears, wolves, cranes, or other creatures.
They nearly all have their totems, or sign-pictures. We write our names with letters;
they use pictures. It is their coat-of-arms. Our names also have meanings.
</p>
<p>The tall, curiously carved totem poles of Alaska are really carved family histories.
Where two or more animals are pictured on one pole it shows the marriage or other
union of different bands to which the family belongs. These totem poles are usually
put up before each native house. The natives will not sell them, for they are valuable
family records.
</p>
<p>A Dakota warrior shot an arrow into the sky; the clouds parted just as his arrow turned
to fall. He was thought to have shot the clouds; he was called Hole-in-the-sky.
</p>
<p>Old Chief Sleepy-eye had a bright mind, but his eyelids did not serve him well; hence
his name.
</p>
<p>In some tribes the little ones are named after the first object that is seen, as Buffalo
Horn, White Pony, Lame Dog, and names that are sometimes better but more often seem
to us not so good.

<p>The Sioux have names for their boys or girls <span class="pageNum" id="pb38">[<a href="#pb38">38</a>]</span>according to their order of birth. The first boy is called Chaska, until by some feat
of bravery he changes it himself. The second son is Harpam; his next brother is Hapeda;
the fourth son is Chatun; and the fifth boy has the name of Harka all ready for him.
</p>
<p>The first girl has the musical name of Winona, and her next younger sister takes the
name of Harpan. Harpstena will be the name of the third girl baby. Waska and Weharka
are for the fourth and fifth girls of a family, and other names are provided for a
greater number of children.
</p>
<p>The Indians have titles and descriptive names for the white people whom they know.
A certain military surgeon who has been among them and has keen, dark eyes and gray
hair is always called Gray Eagle. Their senses are trained to observe very keenly,
and they quickly know each person. Perhaps the paleface might be startled if he understood
the name they gave him.
</p>
<p>Some Indian tribes call the horse Foot-with-one-toe. Few white Americans would have
noticed the horse’s foot so closely.

<p>If you were spending the year among the Sioux or Dakotas, little Winona might tell
you that January is the Hard Moon.
</p>
<p>February is when the braves and the boys take their dogs and hunt the raccoon; hence,
they call it the ’Coon Moon.
</p>
<p>The Sioux have lived for a long time in the north. They know the effect of the bright
sunshine of March when it shines upon the snowdrifts. It is called the Moon of Snow-blindness.
</p>
<p>April is the Egg Moon. It is the moon when the wild geese lay their eggs, and the
Indians gather them for food. The next time you watch the dark triangle of wild geese
flying northward, you can say it is near the time of the Egg Moon of the Dakotas.
</p>
<p>May is the Planting Moon. What! You did not know that the copper-colored people planted
anything? Oh, yes, they do! Remember our maize, or Indian corn, is one great gift
from them.
</p>
<p>June has the prettiest name. Bright, beautiful June that we all love. It is the Strawberry
Moon. The <span class="pageNum" id="pb41">[<a href="#pb41">41</a>]</span>luscious wild strawberries are more delicate in flavor than any grown in the gardens.
The wild Indian has many dainties.
</p>
<p>July, our red-white-and-blue month, is their Moon of Red Lilies. Has it ever been
your good fortune to see a vast tract of land covered with these gorgeous wild tiger-lilies?
O Moon of Red Lilies, how beautiful you make our western prairies! In this same moon
the wild cherry is ripe, and many tribes know it as the Cherry Moon.
</p>
<p>August is the Ripe Moon. Have you ever heard of the Harvest Moon? Is not that nearly
the same name? Seeds from thistle and the milkweed are filling the air with their
downy carriers. Wild grasses and grains are ready for the gatherers, and the maize
will shortly be ready for the harvest.
</p>
<p>While at Lake Superior, some time ago, we saw Chippewa Indians in their birch-bark
canoes, anchored in what seemed to be a very reedy bay. We found out that the bay
was filled with wild rice instead of reeds and rushes. It was the time of their wild-rice
gathering. Two moons are given names referring to wild rice: September is the Ripe-rice
Moon; October is often called the Harvest Moon. With plenty of maize and wild rice
the winter is not dreaded. The Indian puts away his winter stores with much the same
care that his white brother uses; he stores corn in pits <span class="pageNum" id="pb42">[<a href="#pb42">42</a>]</span>that he digs in the earth. He could learn this from the squirrel.
</p>
<p>November is the Moon of Michabo, or Indian Summer. Michabo is another name for Menabozho,
the Chippewa Indian’s manitou friend; he has given them this second summer of the
year, they believe.
</p>
<p>December is the Moon of Dropping Horns. The deer lose their long antlers about this
time, and the Indians can find them in the forests where the deer trails are.
</p>
<p>The Indians have twelve moons in their year, the same number that we have in our calendar.

<h2 class="main">CUSTOMS OF KICKAPOO, SEMINOLE, AND OTHER TRIBES</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The Kickapoo Indians first lived in what is now Illinois. Their present home is in
the Indian Territory. One of their peculiar customs is that they have a tribe whipper
who makes his weekly rounds with his whip to punish children, and in this way the
parents save themselves from the pain of inflicting punishment upon their children.
Indians dislike rudeness or noisy behavior when there should be quiet. Fire-water,
as they call whiskey, makes them forget the manners their parents taught them.
</p>
<p>Many of the Seminole Indians live in the Everglades of Florida. They are a tall, dignified,
intelligent race, and resent the visits of white people unless it is shown that the
visitor is a friend, for they have been driven to these Everglades by reason of conquering
whites. They live in roofed huts and cultivate several kinds of crops. They once owned
rich lands in upper Florida and Alabama. Their language is said to be very musical.
<span class="pageNum" id="pb45">[<a href="#pb45">45</a>]</span></p>
<p>The Cherokee and Natchez tribes once lived in Mississippi and Louisiana. They were
very wise in war and had many things which they manufactured in times of peace. They
carved curious shell ornaments, which are often found in southern mounds.
</p>
<p>The Flathead Indians of the west bind a piece of stiff board upon the forehead of
their papooses. The child’s head flattens as it grows, and he carries his race mark
through life.
</p>
<p>The Blackfoot Indians were so called because during a retreat the burnt prairie grass
stained their moccasins as black as the blackest cayuse or pony.
</p>
<p>The term Digger Indians has been given to various tribes conquered and driven from
their fishing and hunting grounds. They live almost wholly upon roots of weeds or
the few insects and small animals found in the plains of eastern Utah and the surrounding
country. The stronger tribes will not let them fish in lake or stream, and their whole
life is miserable.
</p>
<p>The Indians of California were originally very brave and warlike, but the remnants
of the tribes are broken in spirit and seem broken-hearted. Those which have drifted
or have been driven by whites and red men into the peninsula of southern California
are much like the Diggers.
</p>
<p>The different tribes and nations scattered over America seemed to have known much
about metals, <span class="pageNum" id="pb46">[<a href="#pb46">46</a>]</span>although they used stone arrow points and stone axes when the first explorers visited
their homes.
</p>
<p>The copper mines of Lake Superior show yet where the Indians have mined in them. Gold
and silver ornaments were used in many tribes to decorate the braves and their squaws.
Shells were carved with sharp tools and used as ornaments, or cut small into wampum.
</p>
<p>Arrowheads were of flint or jasper and were made by the arrow makers of the tribe.
It is said each nation had its own shape of arrowhead. Some preferred very small points;
some chose the larger ones.
</p>
<p>The early races of white people in all ancient lands used stone for many purposes.
This first period has been called the Stone Age; this was followed by the Copper Age;
then came the Iron Age. The Indians do not seem to have used iron before white men
came, and were living in what history would call the Stone Age.

<h2 class="main">THE INDIANS WHO LIVE IN BRICK HOUSES</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The native Indians of the southwestern part of the United States were much more civilized
when discovered than the wandering tribes in other parts of the country. They have
built adobe houses for many centuries. These houses of mud, brick, and hewn timbers
cannot be removed like the wigwams, teepees, or wickiups of the other tribes. The
Spaniards named these Indians Pueblos, for <i>pueblo</i> is the Spanish word for village. There are twenty-seven Pueblo towns.
</p>
<p>The Pueblos are a peaceful people. They have had time to invent things that astonish
the white men who have seen only the Indians of the wandering tribes.
</p>
<p>The pueblo of Zuñi is in New Mexico, about two hundred miles southeast of Santa Fé.
This Indian town was sought for by Coronado and his Spanish soldiers. They had heard
marvelous stories of the silver, gold, and jewels owned by the red people living north
of Mexico; but the Pueblos were brave as well as wise, and the history of that Spanish
expedition is sad reading.
</p>
<p>The town of Zuñi is built upon a hill, about forty feet above the bank of the river
Zuñi; it covers about <span class="pageNum" id="pb48">[<a href="#pb48">48</a>]</span>fifteen acres. The town is like a great beehive, for the houses are merely rooms built
one over the other, each family living in a few small rooms which are reached by means
of ladders. Some houses are only two stories high, while others are fully five stories.
The wealthier Indians live in the lower houses, except the official whose duty it
is to give the orders of the governor from the housetop. He lives with his family
in rooms near the roof. These Zuñi houses are built around two plazas, or squares,
with several streets and covered ways to connect them with the other parts of the
town. The mesa called Thunder Mountain, upon which similar homes were built by them
in ancient times, is very near their peaceful village.
</p>
<p>Cliff-dwellings have been found that are entirely deserted, built by a very ancient
people of whom we know little. Curious relics of dishes, cloth, and ornaments are
found in these cliff-dwellings, but no one knows how many centuries since the empty
houses were filled with living people, and no one knows why they were deserted. Some
have thought the Zuñis are the descendants of this lost race; others think them to
be like the mound-builders.
</p>
<p>The Zuñi Indians weave handsome wool blankets in handmade looms. They invented these
looms themselves. They sell or trade these blankets to Indians of many other tribes.
<span class="pageNum" id="pb49">[<a href="#pb49">49</a>]</span></p>
<p></p>
<div class="figure p049width" id="p049"><img src="images/p049.jpg" alt="Three-storied Pueblo Houses in Oraibi" width="621" height="493"><p class="figureHead"><span class="sc">Three-storied Pueblo Houses in Oraibi</span></p>

</div><p>
<span class="pageNum" id="pb50">[<a href="#pb50">50</a>]</span></p>
<p>The Zuñi and other Pueblos make very good dishes of red clay. Their common cooking
ware is much like the dishes seen in wigwams. They make handsome pitchers, vases,
and table dishes of a brown color. They understand the working and coloring of clay,
and the value of the different kinds. They make a common black ware, which is sometimes
used instead of the red ware.
</p>
<p>Their very best work is of a cream-white color, and the vases and dishes are handsomely
decorated with colored borders and pictures. Many travelers have brought home fine
specimens of Zuñi dishes, for their town is not far from the railroad.
</p>
<p>The Navajos live near the Zuñis. Their hogans, or homes, are not so well made as the
Zuñis’ adobe houses; they are low adobe huts. The Navajos find time and have the skill
to do some very good work in metals, although their tools are rude. They make some
use of iron, but their best work is shown in the making and carving of ornaments and
other articles of silver. They also have invented hand looms and are blanket weavers.
</p>
<p>All the Pueblos make handsome water-tight baskets of elegant shape from the fibers
of the yucca plant. This plant, sometimes called the Spanish bayonet, from its sharp-pointed
leaves, grows to a great size on the plains. The Pueblos color the fibers in some
manner <span class="pageNum" id="pb51">[<a href="#pb51">51</a>]</span>and weave handsome borders of black, white, or yellow into their baskets. These are
used for flour or meal holders, or for holding water, and are called ollas.
</p>
<p>They grind their maize or other grain by hand between stones. They raise turkeys,
and, as they are good weavers, they sometimes use the turkey feathers in weaving a
downy cloth.
</p>
<p>The Apaches live near the Pueblos and are well known for their love of the warpath.
They are not Village Indians, yet are noted for their fine basket weaving. They use
the willows found in their country instead of the yucca fibers.
</p>
<p>The different tribes of Pueblos often use stone axes. It is believed that these are
not made by them but were found in the deserted cliff-dwellers’ homes.
</p>
<p>These Village Indians make use of a plant called soaproot, the root of which will
make water foam and will cleanse one’s skin the same as the white man’s soap. The
Indian who lives in a teepee does not know the use of soap and is not anxious for
a bath.
</p>
<p>White people have lived for years among the Zuñi and other Pueblos and have found
them patient, kind, and intelligent. Some of these whites have returned and have written
books about the people of whose home life they have learned so much.
</p>
<p>Some of the habits of the Navajos are very odd. After the death of one of their tribe,
his house, or <span class="pageNum" id="pb52">[<a href="#pb52">52</a>]</span>hogan, is pulled down; if this is not done, every one who enters it fears danger.
</p>
<p>A Navajo will not look into the face of the mother of his wife; when they talk together
he looks on the ground or in another direction. It is said a Navajo once forgot himself
and, looking up, became blind. They believe that the souls of the women of their tribe
enter fish when they leave this world; and they rarely eat fish for that reason. Indian
customs and manners are taught to their children with just as much earnestness as
white people teach their little ones.
</p>
<p>All the Pueblos make curious images or dolls of clay. These may possibly be idols,
but are not always, for both old and young sometimes play with them as toys. They
are a religious people. They believe in a Great Spirit and in a future life. Their
forms of worship are very strange and sometimes cruel.
</p>
<p>The tribes called Pueblos of New Mexico are not included with those which continue
to live in the twenty-seven Pueblo towns, for whatever may have been their customs
in past centuries, they are now very different from the Village Indians, who still
live and worship after the manner of their ancestors.

<h2 class="main">THE MOKI INDIANS</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The Moki Indians live in pueblos the same as the Zuñi people. Their name is also spelled
Moqui and Hopi. The Moki pueblo of Walpi is in Arizona. It is at the end of a mesa
or plateau which rises abruptly seven hundred feet above the desert. It is here that
the great snake dance is held each alternate autumn.
</p>
<p>The Moki weave blankets and cloth for dresses, which they exchange with other Pueblos
for ponies, turquoise beads, and silver ornaments for neck or hair.
</p>
<p>The Moki maidens, like those of a few other tribes, do not leave their straight black
hair hanging down their backs. These maidens put up their locks in huge puffs over
each ear. These puffs are to represent squash blossoms. The married women braid their
hair and sometimes fasten it in a knot at the back of the head.
</p>
<p>All the water used in this elevated pueblo is carried up the seven hundred feet in
clay ollas by the women. It is like a scene in Asia to see them gathered at evening
about the springs at the foot of the mesa.
<span class="pageNum" id="pb55">[<a href="#pb55">55</a>]</span></p>
<p>The Mokis are a very devout people, and their young men are taught daily in the kivas,
or secret rooms, by the wise old men all the sacred rites and wisdom of their fathers.
</p>
<div class="figure p055width" id="p055"><img src="images/p055.jpg" alt="Interior of Kiva with Sacred Altar" width="546" height="425"><p class="figureHead"><span class="sc">Interior of Kiva with Sacred Altar</span></p>
</div><p>
</p>
<p>Among the Mokis the kiva, or <i>estufa</i>, as the Spanish call it, is underground; among the Zuñis it is above the ground,
but entered at the top by a ladder. In it is a sacred flat altar, usually surrounded
by prayer-sticks called bahos. These sticks have a feather fastened at the top, to
show that prayer rises.
</p>
<p>These bahos are always planted two or three times a year by the water ways, to do
reverence to the water god who shows himself in the lightning. They believe <span class="pageNum" id="pb56">[<a href="#pb56">56</a>]</span>a serpent is the form lightning takes when on earth; hence the pictures of these on
the prayer-sticks, and sometimes on the sides of rocks.
</p>
<p>There is an order of nuns among the Pueblos called Ko-Ko. These go to the springs
in the early morning and place the bahos in the banks, so that rain may come on the
corn, beans, and pumpkins which have been planted. No one dares to remove one baho.
</p>
<p>The Moki Indians have stories of Coronado’s people, who battled with them in 1540.

<h2 class="main">DAKOTA OR SIOUX</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The name the French gave the fierce, strong Dakotas is Sioux, which is the way they
pronounced the name given them by their Algonquin neighbors. This has become the name
of the people, and Dakota is the language which they speak.
</p>
<p>They are divided into many bands, each with a chief for a leader. His friends and
relatives move their teepees wherever this chief thinks best on the land the Great
Father in Washington has reserved for them.
</p>
<p>They are very brave and have many wise men among them. The chiefs of the bands are
always ready to follow what the head chief of the nation commands. The head chief
has learned that the Great Father in Washington has more warriors than he, and so
the Sioux are not sent on the warpath any more.
</p>
<p>The buffalo and antelope are gone from the prairie. There is not meat enough in the
woods, and the warlike Sioux has now to come to the Indian agency to get his rations.
It is a fine sight to see the teepees of the bands when they have gathered at the
agency. Even <span class="pageNum" id="pb58">[<a href="#pb58">58</a>]</span>here they show their respect to the head chief and his followers, for his teepees
are placed in the center of the camp. The greatest chief comes next, and so on, till
the weakest band places its teepees last.
</p>
<p>The Sioux who have been long in the south do not speak like their northern relatives.
For example, they say Lakota instead of Dakota. The northern bands laugh at their
southern brothers, and think they have been trying to become different. Many Sioux
boys and girls are in the schools at the agencies learning to write and to read in
English. They are very quick to learn and can draw very well.
</p>
<p>The Sioux women make such beautiful beadwork that a white woman thought it wise to
teach them to make lace of the choicest kind. The young squaws and some of the Indian
boys have learned to make this rare point lace with care and wonderful neatness. They
cannot use it; but the money they get for it buys food and clothes for them and their
relatives.

<h2 class="main">INDIAN GAMES</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<div class="figure floatLeft"><img src="images/it059.png" alt="T" width="542" height="264"></div>
<p class="first">he Dakotas play their ball games in the hot moons of the summer and in the cold moons
of the winter. The prairies give wide room for the games in summer, and the ice on
the many lakes serves as winter ball grounds for them.
</p>
<p>Large spaces are needed, for there are many players. There is only one ball, but there
are as many bats as players. The bats are about thirty inches long, with a loop at
the lower end; this is laced across with deer sinew, to make a pocket in which the
ball is caught and thrown.
</p>
<p>The center of the ball ground is chosen. Stakes are set many feet away from the center,
on opposite sides, as the bounds for the game. Two parties of equal numbers are chosen.
Each party chooses its own leader or chief.
<span class="pageNum" id="pb60">[<a href="#pb60">60</a>]</span></p>
<p>The chief of one side drops his ball into the pocket of his bat and tosses it toward
the center ground between the stakes. Both sides rush toward the place where the ball
may fall, each brave hoping he may be the lucky one to catch it; whoever gets the
ball tosses it with his bat into the air toward his side of the grounds. Then the
screaming, howling mob of players tears across the field to the place where the ball
may fall again. The ball is thrown and contended for until one side succeeds in throwing
it beyond the bounds of the opposite party.
</p>
<p>The prizes for the winning side have hung all this time on the prize pole; and dangling
in the air, waiting the finish of the game, are the knives, tomahawks, blankets, moccasins,
fine buffalo and deerskin robes which the winners will divide among themselves. Indian
girls play the same game and with nearly as much vigor and skill as their brothers.
</p>
<p>Always, at these games, the old men and squaws sit or stand at the outside of the
ball ground, a mass of interested spectators.
</p>
<p>The ball game in some form, it seems, has been the national game on American soil
since before American history began.
</p>
<p>The plum-stone game was and is yet played by the northern Indian tribes. The Dakotas
call it kansoo­kootaype, which simply means “shooting plum-stones.” <span class="pageNum" id="pb61">[<a href="#pb61">61</a>]</span>Each plum-stone is painted black on one side and red on the other side. The stones
are also cut on one side to make them of different value according to the meaning
of the marks cut.
</p>
<p>These black and red stones are put into a large shallow dish of clay or metal. The
dish is struck against the nearest object with a sharp blow. The stones fall black
or red side up, and the betting on the number of black or red stones makes the game.
</p>
<p>It is pure gambling. The prizes are valuable,—furs, clothing, food, everything goes
in the excitement of the game. An Indian may be beggared in a minute.
</p>
<p>Father Hennepin describes the excitement of the game in his <i>Descriptions of Louisiana</i>, published in Paris in 1683. This book is a description of his travels at that time
in the valley of the Mississippi to the Falls of St. Anthony and beyond. Father Hennepin
said:
</p>
<p>“There are some so given to the game that they will gamble away even their greatcoat.
Those who conduct the game scream at the top of their voices when they rattle the
platter; and they strike their shoulders so hard as to make themselves black and blue
with the blow.”
</p>
<p>The Indian boys have their pony races and running matches. They play much like white
boys, but with more cruelty.

<h2 class="main">SIOUX AND CHIPPEWAS OF MINNESOTA</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first"></p>
<div class="figure floatLeft"><img src="images/it062.png" alt="T" width="220" height="223"></div>
<p class="first">he Iroquois drove the Chippewas, or Ojibways, from their hunting grounds and from
fishing in many waters in central New York; as the bands increased and more needed
food, many started westward, and Chippewa names of lakes and rivers mark their progress
toward the Mississippi. They made a long halt at the Sault Ste. Marie, for many fish
were in these waters, but there was no place to plant their corn. They built their
wigwam fires farther westward each year, until they reached what is now northern Minnesota.
Here they found the Dakotas, or Sioux, had possession of the beautiful lake region,
which was so nearly like the country by the River of Islands in the east.
</p>
<p>The Chippewas had no wish to go back, and their warriors and chiefs were too brave
to think that even the fierce western tribes could conquer them. They built their
wigwams on islands and points of land projecting into the lake, for these made good
places of <span class="pageNum" id="pb63">[<a href="#pb63">63</a>]</span>landing for their birch-bark canoes, and also gave them a better chance to watch for
their enemies than in the thick forests of pine, birch, and cedar.
</p>
<p>Each band of Chippewas has yet many stories to tell of the terrible battles with the
“nadoway-sioux,” as the French trappers and hunters call the Algonquin word which
means “hidden enemies.” This warfare began years before the time of our war of the
Revolution and did not end for nearly a century. The Chippewas fought for their new
home very bravely, and the Sioux were just as brave in trying to hold what they believed
to be the center of the world and nearest like the Happy Hunting Grounds of the future
life. There is a very extensive view of the Mississippi at its junction with the Minnesota
which is called by the Indians Mendota, or the “gathering of the waters.” The contending
tribes fought fiercely to hold or to obtain this place, for here these red men, with
their love for the beautiful in nature, had decided was where many of their gods liked
best to stay. The building of Fort Snelling at this point and the arrival of white
men put a stop to the battles, and neither tribe could claim Mendota.
</p>
<p>The Great Father in Washington made a treaty with the Chippewas whereby they hold
much of their hard-won lake region as long as they keep their treaty promises; now
that there is peace between the Indian <span class="pageNum" id="pb64">[<a href="#pb64">64</a>]</span>nations they are willing to admit that each had many heroes in war and council.
</p>
<p>During the conflict a trader attempted to bargain with the Sioux for furs, after having
had dealings with a band of Chippewas. This band, wild with fury at what they called
the trader’s treachery, broke open his storehouse and destroyed or took all his stores
of furs and other articles. They were called Pillagers by the French and other bands,
and hold the name yet and are proud of it, for the deed was done openly and for the
sake of their nation.
</p>
<p>The Pillagers are nearly all Blanket Indians. They live in wigwams in summer and cover
these with bark huts in winter for greater warmth. The wigwams are covered with woven
mats made of reeds or grass and birch bark. The huts are like a one-room house and
are covered also with pine or birch bark. Each spring these Indians make large quantities
of maple sugar, which they pack in mokuks, or birch-bark baskets, and sell or exchange
at the stores in towns. During the summer they pick and sell the berries which grow
near the woods and lakes. They have gardens of maize, squash, pumpkins, beans, and
onions, and some raise potatoes. Their meat supply is getting scarce, as the deer,
moose, and bear are being hunted so freely by white men. The men often dress in true
Indian costumes, with buckskin leggings, beadwork ornaments, <span class="pageNum" id="pb66">[<a href="#pb66">66</a>]</span>blankets, and a feather in their scalp lock if they have killed an enemy; this honor
is hard to give up, and even a murderer of one of his own tribe has dared to wear
the eagle feather.
</p>
<p></p>

</div><p>
</p>
<p>There is a large government school at Leech Lake, and many of the boys and girls have
learned the customs and books of the white people, but when they return to their wigwam
homes there is little chance to change the home life, except in very simple ways.
</p>
<p>Some of the finest work in lace, which has been taught in the Indian schools, has
been done by these Chippewas at Leech Lake. They were so artistic in their bead and
basket work that a lady who saw the point lace made in the mission schools in Japan
decided to teach it to all the squaws who would learn the art. Their success has been
a pleasure to her and to them. It brings the money with which to buy food.
</p>
<p>The lakes near the source of the Great River abound in wild rice, which is gathered
in August and stored in mokuks for winter use. The wild swan, geese, and ducks also
feed upon it, and they make good hunting.
</p>
<p>The extensive pine forests owned by the Chippewas have attracted many white men who
are trying to gain possession of them, but the wise chiefs know their value and their
people’s need, and they remember the years of warfare when the land was won; neither
have they yet broken their treaty promises. A few years <span class="pageNum" id="pb67">[<a href="#pb67">67</a>]</span>ago the courts wanted several of the Leech Lake Indians for witnesses in a trial.
It was cold, and if the men went their families would suffer, for they must be gone
some weeks. The old chief would not let them go until the government promised money
to support their families. The white men in council did not think best to make the
promise, and the chief refused to send the witnesses. The soldiers came to take the
men forcibly. There was a battle, and soldiers fell and much money was spent, but
still the chief has not given up the men. The white people feel that the Indian chief
had much in his favor, for he would not see his people suffer; the squaws and papooses
must be cared for, and he had not the money with which to buy food for them.
</p>
<p>The Sioux in southern Minnesota made an uprising during the Civil War. Some friendly
Indians warned the whites of the coming troubles and helped them to escape. A monument
erected in 1900 to these good Indians shows the friendly feeling of the whites to
their rescuers. These Indians were called traitors by the Sioux and had to flee for
their own lives. Some of them settled at Mendota and are much respected by their white
friends. The son of one became an Episcopal minister. The present chief of all the
Chippewas is also a minister of the same church and an able leader of his people.

by the Moravian missionaries. Hence his American name, which is famous in history
and romance.
</p>
<p>There was another Chief Logan who was for a time chief among the Delawares. This chief
lost an eye in a battle and was then deprived of his position, as a chief must be
physically perfect.
</p>
<p>History has preserved the names of numbers of Indians famous in war and peace.
</p>
<p>Samoset, who greeted the Pilgrims with the cordial “Welcome, Englishmen,” is one of
the first on the list. <span class="pageNum" id="pb69">[<a href="#pb69">69</a>]</span>Squanto, Massasoit, Canonicus, Miantonomoh are well known in New England history.
These are the names of men who kept their promises and fought bravely for their white
friends.
</p>
<p>King Philip saw the ruin of his country and people and commanded an uprising. He was
a terrible warrior, and his name is both famous and infamous. Tecumseh, Red Cloud,
Black Hawk, and others are well known in western history. These names and hundreds
of others are kept in memory as the names of cities, rivers, or lakes.

<h2 class="main">A NAVAJO MEDICINE CHANT</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The Navajos give a medicine dance and chant a long song when a sick person asks for
this service. This chant is the story in song of the capture and escape of a young
Navajo brave. He is helped by his people’s gods, who are like the creatures that live
in his own country.
</p>
<p>This is the part of the chant telling of his escape:
</p>
<p class="tb"></p><p>
</p>
<p>“He came to the house of the Butterfly. It was filled with butterflies and rainbows.
</p>
<p>“Kacluge, the great Butterfly, welcomed him to his lodge. His wife took the young
brave by the hand. He was welcome.
</p>
<p>“She left the room, but came back with a great pearl dish in her hand. It was a sea-shell
filled with water. She gave him soapweed. He washed and was white. He dried his hands
with meal and painted his face with white earth; then he was fair as a white man.
<span class="pageNum" id="pb71">[<a href="#pb71">71</a>]</span></p>
<p>“Kacluge gave him fine white moccasins. He gave him a collar of beaver skin, and a
whistle to call for help.
</p>
<p>“His arms looked like wings, for plumed prayer-sticks were fastened to them in the
Butterfly’s lodge.
</p>
<p>“The young man was no longer tired. He was strong again, and like a white butterfly
in beauty. Kacluge fed him with white corn meal mixed with pure water. He slept in
the house of the Butterfly.
</p>
<p>“In the morning the young Navajo stepped on the white sand. The wife of the Butterfly
put two burning lines of white lightning before his feet. He stepped upon these, and
his white moccasins fastened to the lightning.
</p>
<p>“ ‘Now,’ said the Butterfly, ‘the lightning is yours; follow where it leads.’
</p>
<p>“With one step he stood on a high hill. He saw a flash of lightning fill the valley.
</p>
<p>“ ‘It is the trail I must follow,’ said the young Navajo. Across the valley, on the
trail of the lightning, he ran to the mountains; and now, pure in face, in heart,
and with white feet, the lightning led him home.”

<p class="first">n the old days all men lived in caves in the center of the earth. There were four
caves, one over the other. Men first lived in the lowest cave. It was dark. There
was no light, and the cave was crowded. All men were full of sorrow.
</p>
<p class="tb"></p><p>
</p>
<p>“The Holder of the Paths of Life, the Sun-father, heard the people cry. He created
two children for himself, and they fell to the earth to help the cave people.
</p>
<p>“The Sun-father gave his two children eternal youth. He gave them power to do things
as he would do them. He gave them gifts. One gift was a painted bow that reached from
one end of the sky to the farther end. It was the rainbow. He gave them an arrow of
fire. It was the lightning. He gave them a great shield <span class="pageNum" id="pb74">[<a href="#pb74">74</a>]</span>like his own. The shield was a net of cotton cords on a hoop of wood, and the last
gift, a great magic war knife of flint, was fastened to the center of the shield.

</p>
<p>“After the two children had cut the face of the earth with the stone war knife, they
rode on the magic shield to the lowest cave where men lived. There they lived with
mankind as leaders.
</p>
<p>“The priests prayed to the Sun-children for help in the darkness. The Sun-children
led mankind into the second cave; it was still all darkness. Men asked the priests
to pray for more help. They came to the Sun-children, and the people were led into
the third world or cave.
</p>
<p>“This was a larger world than the other two. It was like twilight in this cave, but
at first all thought that they had reached the blazing sun, it was so light.
</p>
<p>“After a thousand years this cave became crowded. Men sought the priests and prayed
them to find some way to help them.
</p>
<p>“The two Sun-children cut their way through the cave above them, and led the people
out upon the earth. It was only a small island, for all the rest was water.
</p>
<p>“Men covered their faces with their hands, for the light made them blind. They fell
down and tried to hide in the sand, they were so hot. The people were taught to make
clothing of yucca fiber. Their eyes <span class="pageNum" id="pb75">[<a href="#pb75">75</a>]</span>were like owls’ eyes, and they covered them with their hands till they were strong.
</p>
<p>“The Sun-children led the people over the quaking earth to the east, where the Sun-father
had his home.
</p>
<p>“The Sun-children were told to dry the earth. They put the magic shield upon the earth
and laid the rainbow upon it. They put arrows of lightning to the north, south, east,
and west, and the arrows crossed each other. The older brother shot with an arrow
the lightning arrows where they crossed upon the rainbow.
</p>
<p>“Thlu-tchu! the lightning arrows shot toward every point. Fire rolled over the face
of the earth. The earth was dried when the fire storm was over.
</p>
<p>“The earth was then full of great beasts that had lived in the water. The Sun-children
shot the beasts with their arrows; then the beasts became stone. The people were free
to go on the earth wherever they wanted to go.
</p>
<p>“Thus the people were led out of the deep caves; thus the land became dry, and men
came to live on the earth.”

<h2 class="main">INTRODUCTORY—INDIAN STORIES</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The Indians, when trying to speak English, often use very short sentences with easy
words, just as foreigners do. They will repeat a statement in different ways, so that
their listeners will be sure to understand; this makes the stories they tell sound
very queer sometimes.
</p>
<p>The Indians do not like to have any one laugh at them. It is not an easy matter to
get them to tell their legends about trees, rocks, or living creatures. They once
believed that everything had its manitou, or spirit, which took care of it, but by
their contact with the white people they have lost much of their fear of these manitous,
and also much of their faith in their power.
</p>
<p>The paleface must show himself a very good friend indeed before he is allowed to hear
the stories told to native guests or to the children. The white friend may be a hunter,
and then his Indian guide will tell in his own way stories connected with objects
seen by them in the forest, on the plain, or on the mountain.
<span class="pageNum" id="pb80">[<a href="#pb80">80</a>]</span></p>
<p>Henry R. Schoolcraft, an American geologist, was much among the red men, from eastern
New York to the source of the Mississippi, which he discovered. He married the granddaughter
of a chief. He was allowed to hear the ancient legends, and published them in prose
form in 1830.
</p>
<p>Henry W. Longfellow read them with so much interest that he told them again in his
beautiful poem of <i>Hiawatha</i>, weaving into the story the bride Minnehaha of whom the Indians have no legend.
</p>
<p>The Ojibways, or Chippewas, tell stories of a hero called by them Menabozho. He is
called the Foolish or Sly One; he is always playing tricks, for which he is usually
punished. Many of these Chippewa stories which they are telling of him even now are
woven into the poem of <i>Hiawatha</i>, as the poet thought that Iroquois name more musical than Menabozho, and, like many
others, supposed the Iroquois and the Chippewas to be the same people.
</p>
<p>As they have no written language, their legends may change a little; the same story
may be told in different ways, and the words they use may have various forms.

<p class="first">he white man laughs much. The Indian is wise. He can see a joke, but he does not laugh
as much as the white man. The papoose and the squaw may laugh. The brave must not
let his face show what he feels. It is not wise.
</p>
<p>The white man has stories to tell his children, and his children laugh. The Indian
tells the stories of Iagoo to his children. The teepee is shut, for it is winter,
and you cannot hear the papoose laugh.
</p>
<p>The white man when he tells a story which is not true says, “Once on a time.” The
Indian says, “My grandfather told me.” The papooses know when the story is true. An
Indian teaches his children to tell the truth; his children are wise; they speak the
truth to their tribe.
</p>
<p>Lame Buffalo could tell good stories. His children were happy, and they laughed often
in their father’s teepee. There was a fire of sticks in the middle of <span class="pageNum" id="pb82">[<a href="#pb82">82</a>]</span>the teepee, but the smoke was not bad; it went out of the teepee by the top of the
poles.
</p>
<p>Lame Buffalo sat with his wife White Deer and their children around the fire in the
teepee. The oldest boy asked for a story.
</p>
<p>Lame Buffalo told this story of Iagoo:
</p>
<p class="tb"></p><p>
</p>
<p>“In the days of my grandfather, Iagoo used to come often to the lodges of our tribe.
</p>
<p>“Iagoo was tall. He was straight as a pine that stands alone on the hilltop. He was
always hungry. He would come to a lodge of our tribe, my grandfather said, and would
look at the duck the squaw was roasting. He would tell her no squaw could make such
a fire as she could. No one could bake in the ashes as she could. When the duck was
done, the squaw would put it on a stone by Iagoo. She and her papooses had no duck.
They were hungry, but Iagoo did not go away hungry.
</p>
<p>“The braves were always glad to see Iagoo, for his stories were never the same. He
saw things no other Indian ever saw. He knew more than any other brave ever knew;
he said so himself. He never went into battle, for he had much to keep him away; yet
he wore eagle feathers in his scalp lock. He told great stories of battles, but no
one ever saw him when he was fighting. It is not wise to look around in battle.”
<span class="pageNum" id="pb83">[<a href="#pb83">83</a>]</span></p>
<p>“Iagoo told my grandfather this story of the mosquitoes that lived on the marsh. His
tribe had their teepees by this marsh.
</p>
<p>“Iagoo said that he heard one day a great roaring. It was like ten bears, but he was
the only brave who dared to go out to see what the roaring was. He saw mosquitoes
flying in the tamarack trees in the swamp, but he could not tell the trees from the
mosquitoes, they were both so big.
</p>
<p>“He killed three mosquitoes with his war club. He shot them first with his arrows.
Iagoo tore off the left wing of one, and he made a sail for his birch-bark canoe from
that wing.
</p>
<p>“He called to his wife. His wife heard, for his voice and his war club drove away
the mosquitoes. His wife came out to see the battle, but they were gone. She tore
off the bill of one of the slain mosquitoes and used it to dig with, and she used
it twelve moons.”
</p>
<p>“Ugh! It is good,” said the oldest boy.
</p>
<hr class="tb"><p>
</p>
<p>“Another time Iagoo was on a trail. The trail was a creek with no water. It went through
the land of the river where the buffaloes feed when it is wet.
</p>
<p>“The trail was wide and full of sand. The dry grass was on the side of it. Iagoo saw
on the sand of the trail a new animal. It was far from him, but it was large. He could
see it. It was long as a wildcat, but it <span class="pageNum" id="pb84">[<a href="#pb84">84</a>]</span>had no hair like the wildcat. It had two horns like the buffalo. It had many legs,
and its eyes were like fire.
</p>
<p>“Iagoo took his war club with his two hands. He walked like a brave in battle. He
ran on the trail to kill the strange beast. He raised his war club to strike it, but
it was nothing but a big ant dragging a rabbit to its hole in the trail. Iagoo sat
down in the sand and laughed, while the ant pulled the rabbit into the ant-hole. The
rabbit was killed by the ant. Iagoo said so, and he knew it. The ant killed the rabbit
with its horns.”
</p>
<p>“Ugh! ugh! ugh!” said the boys around the fire.
</p>
<p>White Deer laughed, and her daughters laughed.
</p>
<p>“Tell another,” said the boys.
</p>
<hr class="tb"><p>
</p>
<p>“My grandfather said that Iagoo told of the willow trees. Iagoo went to the willow
trees to take some of the little creeping-cats from them. They are the flowers that
come when the snow has melted.
</p>
<p>“The willow trees looked small to Iagoo. He broke off a branch and went to get one
on the other side of the tree. He made a heavy trail around the tree to mark the bush.
The sun was over his head when he began to make the trail. He walked around that one
willow bush, and the sun was going down in the lake when he was done. It was a long
trail. No one but Iagoo ever saw such a willow bush.”
<span class="pageNum" id="pb85">[<a href="#pb85">85</a>]</span></p>
<p>White Deer laughed. She had gathered many willows for weaving.
</p>
<p>The oldest boy looked at his brothers. They were laughing too. He did not laugh, but
said “Ugh!” like a great chief.
</p>
<p>Lame Buffalo looked at the fire. White Deer put on more sticks and blew the fire with
her breath; when it began to blaze Lame Buffalo went on with more stories of Iagoo.
</p>
<hr class="tb"><p>
</p>
<p>“My grandfather said that Iagoo went in the cold moon of winter to the south. He went
alone in his canoe. His tribe was in the far north, in the fur country. Iagoo liked
to fish. His wife could hunt for the fur skins, for it is cold in the far north.
</p>
<p>“Iagoo let his canoe drift like a leaf as he fished. It drifted near the shore of
the river, then Iagoo stepped out on the shore. It sank under his feet. As the water
came over where he stepped, he saw that he had not stepped on land. He had stepped
on a thick lily leaf.
</p>
<p>“Iagoo jumped back into his canoe. He broke the stem of the lily leaf with his fishing
spear and put the great leaf in his canoe. It covered him and the canoe. He dried
the leaf and rolled it in a pack. He went back to the far north when he had fished
all he wanted to, and he gave the leaf to his squaw. She was glad. It <span class="pageNum" id="pb86">[<a href="#pb86">86</a>]</span>was like a wide buffalo skin; she made dresses for herself and her daughters out of
it. No other squaws had such fine dresses.”
</p>
<p>White Deer smiled, and the little girls laughed. They knew the pond-lily leaves were
small in the lakes; they could not be so wide in a river.
</p>
<p>“It is a story for squaws,” said the oldest boy.
</p>
<p>“We will go to sleep,” said Lame Buffalo, his father.
</p>
<p>The next night Lame Buffalo told this story of Iagoo for the boys:
</p>
<hr class="tb"><p>
</p>
<p>“A white man gave Iagoo a gun, so my grandfather said. He could shoot better than
any white man.
</p>
<p>“Iagoo went hunting. It was the time for ducks. He went in his canoe, and he hid in
the rice by the ducks. The ducks flew up and made the sun dark. He lay on his back
and shot straight into the flock of ducks. A swan fell dead into his canoe. Its head
was shot off; the ducks fell around his canoe like hail in a hailstorm; the water
was black with the ducks he shot. He piled them up like a great teepee on the shore.
He shot them all with one gunshot.
</p>
<p>“The shot from his gun fell back into the lake; it struck two loons and killed them.
The shot fell through the loons and killed a muskalonge; this is the great fish that
lives in the lakes. No one else ever fired such a shot as did Iagoo. He told this
to my grandfather.”
<span class="pageNum" id="pb87">[<a href="#pb87">87</a>]</span></p>
<p>“It is good,” said the boys.
</p>
<p>“Tell another,” said White Deer.
</p>
<p class="tb"></p><p>
</p>
<p>“Iagoo went hunting in the Hunting Moon. He killed a great deer and threw it on his
back. It was heavy, but he must have food in his teepee.
</p>
<p>“He sat down on a stump to rest. He was very still, and he saw the great elks go by
him on their trail to the far north. It was like a great tribe going north. The trail
they made was deep, and they did not see nor smell Iagoo.
</p>
<p>“The first elk had horns like a great tree. He was very big; Iagoo wanted him; Iagoo
ran swifter than all the elks; he came to the leader; he shot the leader of the elks;
he fell like a tree in the forest; Iagoo lifted the elk to throw him over his shoulder;
the elk horns struck the deer horns. Iagoo knew then that he had carried a big deer
all day. Iagoo was not tired. He hung the deer in a tree and carried the elk home.
No other brave in his tribe had ever brought home an elk with such horns. Iagoo said
so to my grandfather.”
</p>
<p>Lame Buffalo stopped.
</p>
<p>There are more stories of Iagoo, the great story-teller, but Lame Buffalo did not
tell any more.

</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The Indians in the west tell this story:
</p>
<p>A squaw left her two boys to care for her papoose while she worked. She was hidden
in the wickiup, or tent, and did not see what the boys were doing until the papoose
began to cry.
</p>
<p>The squaw found them all down by the river. They could not stir, for their feet were
stuck fast in the wet clay of the river bank. She got her three children back to the
wickiup. They laughed at their footprints in the clay, for they had left deep holes
everywhere.
</p>
<p>The band of Indians left their camp before the sun was over their heads. The squaw,
with her papoose and her boys, was soon far away from the river bank; but during the
hot summer, which was soon upon them, the same band returned to the river they had
left.
</p>
<p></p>

</div><p>
</p>
<p>The two little Indian boys went down to the clay bank where they had stuck fast. No
rain had fallen <span class="pageNum" id="pb90">[<a href="#pb90">90</a>]</span>since they had been there, and they found their footprints in the clay. These had
dried until the mud was like stone.
</p>
<p>The squaw came and looked at the holes. She took some clay in her hands and wet it
in the river, then she shaped it like the hollow stone she used for cooking. She dried
the clay in the sun, and it was soon hard.
</p>
<p>An old chief saw the clay dishes and told the other squaws to make them, but the clay
dishes would not hold water and broke very easily.
</p>
<p>A squaw put some ashes and fire in her dish one day. She wanted to save the fire,
for it was hard to get. The hot coals baked the dish, and it would not break. It held
water; then the Indians knew how to make their clay dishes in the right way.

<p class="first">ear the Falls of Winniwissi is a great rock; it is as tall as two braves. The water
manitous have cut the sides of this rock; it is smooth on the top; it is smooth on
the sides; it is like a piece of ice in the Big Sea Water.
</p>
<p>It is small on the top. A brave, if he lay down on it and put out his hands, would
put his hands on nothing. It is small; it is a high rock.
</p>
<p>When they gathered in the Pipestone Valley the chiefs stood by this rock. It is in
the Valley of Peace. The young braves stood by this rock. The chiefs tried the young
braves here, for this was Leaping Rock. It stood above all the other rocks.
</p>
<p>The chiefs called the young braves of their tribes. The young braves came. The chiefs
said: “Leap from this trail in the valley to the top of Leaping Rock. Then you are
brave; then you are strong.”
</p>
<p>It was a leap as high as two braves are long. It was a leap like an arrow shot into
the sky; like an <span class="pageNum" id="pb92">[<a href="#pb92">92</a>]</span>arrow which falls and breaks on the rocks the young braves fell sometimes.
</p>
<p>Sometimes the young brave was strong; he would stand on the slippery rock like an
eagle resting on the mountain. It was well. He was then a great brave. The chief of
his tribe gave him the feather of an eagle to wear, for only a strong brave may wear
a feather in his scalp lock.
</p>
<p>A Dakota maiden had two lovers. She told them to go to Leaping Rock. They went; one
came back. The other the chiefs buried where he fell as he slid from Leaping Rock.
The maiden took the one who came back; but she was missed one day, and they found
her at the foot of Leaping Rock with eagle feathers for the Pawnee’s grave.
</p>
<p>“He was brave but no one mourns for him. He shall have two eagle feathers,” she said.

<p class="first">The great stone pipes of all tribes of Indians are made in the Valley of Peace. The
Valley of Peace has high walls of rock. This rock is soft when it is first cut; it
is red and white.
</p>
<p>No Indian may harm any one in this valley. Enemies must not know war here. Dakotas,
Chippewas, Pawnees, tribes of the south and tribes of the north buried their tomahawks
when they met in the Valley of Peace. This is true; the tribes gathered here to make
their calumets. The calumet is the pipe of peace.
</p>
<p>The Falls of the Winniwissi are in the Pipestone Valley. The music of the falling
water is like the song of peace.
</p>
<p>Near the Falls of Winniwissi is a high rock. When the braves come to the Valley of
Peace they see a great face in this rock. They see it when far away on the long trail.
It is the face of the Great Manitou. It is the face of the Great Spirit.
</p>
<p>All the tribes believe that the water spirits cut this face on the rock. It is Wahkan.
It is sacred.
<span class="pageNum" id="pb94">[<a href="#pb94">94</a>]</span></p>
<p>The Dakotas believe that Toonkan, the oldest of all the gods, lives in stone. Stone
was made first. Toonkan lived first. He lives in every rock. He loves best the great
rocks. They are his home. The Indians worship the face in the rock. It is Toonkan
watching them. He will bring them back alive from battle. He will help them in the
fight with the bear.
</p>
<p>The Indians lift their pipes and let the smoke blow toward the Great Stone Face. They
sing songs to him; he helps the tribes.
</p>
<p>There is another Great Spirit who lives in the sun. These two Great Spirits know each
other.
</p>
<p>The Dakota prays to the sun. One of his prayers is this:
</p>
<p>“Wahkan Ate! onshemada!” (“Sacred Spirit, Father! have mercy on me.”)
</p>
<p>The Chippewas fear their manitous. They are careful not to offend them; there are
many little manitous; there are many manitous that try to do harm. The good manitous
are wiser than the bad manitous. The Indian must not forget to pray to the Great Manitou.
He must not forget the little manitous.

<p class="first">he Indian has a great pride in and love for his band and nation. There is a story
of two captive squaws who were promised life and freedom if they would lead their
captors to the place where the squaws’ own people were hidden.
</p>
<p>The squaws told their captors to bring many canoes; then, acting as guides, leaped
into the front canoe, calling on their captors to follow them. The long line of boats
swept quickly down the stream. Every one was merry but the two squaws; their faces
showed the sorrow in their hearts.
</p>
<p>The river grew narrower, and the current grew swifter. The warriors called to the
squaws to know if they were going the right way.
</p>
<p>“This is the shortest way to our wigwams. Make ready your arrows. You will see the
smoke of our campfires. We will lead the band who will kill our braves.”
<span class="pageNum" id="pb97">[<a href="#pb97">97</a>]</span></p>
<p>The squaws stood up in their canoe. They threw their paddles far out into the white
water of the rapids. They gave the war whoop of their people.
</p>
<p>The warriors saw the canoe which held the two captive squaws stand still. It was caught
for one minute by a rock, then it leaped forward like a great fish and was out of
sight. There was no hope for any of the canoes. Down, over the falls they went, one
by one. The squaws had led their captors by the shortest way, but it was the way of
death to each one.
</p>
<p>The braves they were seeking were hidden in a cave at the foot of the waterfall. The
broken canoes, scattered garments, arrows, and bodies told the story of their rescue
by the brave squaws. Now the squaws of their band sing in the great war dance and
chant of the bravery of women.

<p class="first">he Great Spirit sent two cranes from the world above the sky. They came through an
opening between the clouds and tried to find a place upon the earth. The Great Spirit
told them when they were suited with some spot to fold their wings closely to their
sides and wait; a change would come over them.
</p>
<p>The pair of cranes flew down to the earth and began to search for a home. They went
to the prairies and tasted the buffalo meat. It was good, but there were many days
when no buffalo was in sight. They feared that the food would not last, and the two
cranes flew to a great forest.
</p>
<p>In the forest they tasted of the flesh of the elk, the deer, and many other animals.
It was good meat, but it was hard work to hunt, and many days there were neither elk
nor deer in sight.
<span class="pageNum" id="pb99">[<a href="#pb99">99</a>]</span></p>
<p>Then the two cranes flew to the Great Lakes. They tasted of many kinds of fish. They
came to the rapids in the outlet of the lake white men call Lake Superior. Many fish
were in this outlet; every day the fish seemed more plentiful than the day before.
</p>
<p>“We will find food here forever. We will make our home here,” said the two cranes.
</p>
<p>They flew away from fishing in the waters. The two cranes stood on a little hill near
the rapids and folded their wings closely to their sides. The Great Spirit saw their
faith, and they were changed into a man and a woman. Among the Ojibways there is a
tribe called the Cranes, who believe they are the children of these two cranes sent
by the Great Spirit to the earth.

</p>
<p>The Great Manitou had his home in the Land of Peace. Before he became a man and his
face was cut in the stone, he was a great bird and his nest was in the pipestone rocks.
</p>
<p>He fed on the wild buffaloes that lived on the prairies. He could carry two buffaloes
in his claws; he always ate them near his nest; this is why the rocks are red.
</p>
<p>The tracks of the manitou bird can be seen near the Land of Peace. The Indians know
where to find these tracks and will show them to the white man.
</p>
<p>The Great Serpent is older than mankind. He was alive before the first man was made.
He found the nest of the manitou bird; there was one egg in the nest. The manitou
heard the egg move. He was miles away, <span class="pageNum" id="pb102">[<a href="#pb102">102</a>]</span>but he flew with a great rock in his claws and killed the serpent. The rock broke
open the egg, and out of it came a grown man, but the rock lay upon his feet and he
could not walk. He had to stand in one place, for the manitou bird would not set him
free until he knew many things.
</p>
<p>The man learned how to hunt the buffalo, for he could see many miles. He learned how
to tan and use the buffalo skin; he learned the language of birds; they would come
when he would call their names; he learned how to make and use the bow and arrow.
</p>
<p>The manitou bird covered the man with a great buffalo skin, but his head was not covered,
for he had much black hair. The first man was slow to learn and he stood many moons
in his place in the pipestone rocks; nothing came to hurt him.
</p>
<p>When he had learned much, he woke one morning and found a woman standing beside him.
The manitou bird pulled away the stone from the feet of the man. He shook his wings
and the man and woman ran to the prairie.
</p>
<p>These two were the first of all people. They were Indians. All mankind know they were
the first to live on the earth.

<p class="first">he Indians in the forest have many stories of giants. The red men are very proud of
their own people, who can lift the greatest weight, run the fastest races, or suffer
the most pain without making a sound. You see the Indian is not so very different
in some ways from the white man.
</p>
<p class="tb"></p><p>
</p>
<p>Kwasind, among the Chippewas, was a strong weedigo, or giant. He it was that threw
the rock into the Sault Ste. Marie. He could not be hurt except in one place; that
was in the back of his head. Kwasind was foolish enough to tell this to one of the
little water people. He told a little nibanabas that if the little people of the forest,
the pukwudjinnies, could hit him with cones from the pine trees, he would die. But
he knew he was very tall, and the pukwudjinnies were no larger than a little papoose.
</p>
<p>The little people of the forest soon heard the secret. They left the shores of the
swift river and went to look for pine cones. They found them and brought many <span class="pageNum" id="pb104">[<a href="#pb104">104</a>]</span>back. They hid by the river until Kwasind came in his great canoe asleep; the nibanabas
had sung him to sleep. The little people threw their cones into the canoe and hit
Kwasind on the back of his head. The wicked giant never hurt any one again.
</p>
<p>There was another giant who lived near Narragansett Bay. His wife grew angry with
him and went across the bay to live alone. If a fisherman drifted near her wigwam
by the shore, she always turned him into a great rock. A terrible storm came from
the sea and washed away these rocks and her wigwam; after that the fishermen were
not afraid.

<p>Weenk is the sandman of the Ojibway or Chippewa children. He comes every night and
brings so many tiny warriors with him that each eyelid is conquered and closed till
morning.
</p>
<p>The Ojibway mother puts her papoose to sleep in a tiny hammock made of bark, fastened
with sinew thongs and lined with soft, dry moss. She sings strange slumber songs to
the wee one, and the older children stand by her in the summer evenings and whisper
little stories of Weenk and his warriors.
</p>
<p>“Weenk is a bee as big as a buffalo,” they say. “He has bees’ wings instead of hair.
The wings sing and sing. They buzz and buzz. He is always sleepy. He brings sleep
to children. The little one must go to sleep; Weenk has come.
<span class="pageNum" id="pb106">[<a href="#pb106">106</a>]</span></p>
<p>“Weenk is a good man. He brings many little manitous to help him, and they go everywhere.
There is one on the papoose’s eyelid now. They are dancing in the little one’s hair.
Buzz, buzz, buzz.”
</p>
<p>“Here is a war club one of the little manitous has lost,” a sister will say as she
picks up a tiny hair.
</p>
<p>“Here is a feather from a scalp lock,” says another, as she holds up a fiber from
some feather. So the fun goes on until finally the little papoose is asleep.
</p>
<p>“We will fight Weenk,” say the children, and then there is a battling of empty hands
in the air, while they sing “Buzz, buzz, buzz.”
</p>
<p>“Wewahsta has lighted her lamp,” says the squaw mother as she sees the evening star.
Then the children know it is time for them to lie down to sleep, and soon the wigwam
is still.
</p>
<p>The story of buzzing Weenk and his band is fresh every evening, for they always tell
new stories of what the little warriors can do. Sometimes they come on the fireflies,
and sometimes the mosquitoes and busy gnats bring them. Indian children are much like
their white brothers and sisters and find sport in many things.

<p class="first">wo Indians from the Seneca Reservation went hunting; they went on a long trail, but
at last found a place where the deer come to eat the salt that is in the sand; it
is called a “salt lick.” The Indians waited in the trees until many deer came; they
shot at the deer, which fell like wild ducks when the rice is ripe.
</p>
<p>The Indians had to throw away much meat in order to save the skins for leather. There
was more meat than the wolves could eat, but the hunters shot many deer every day,
until no more came.
</p>
<p>The hunters went on carrying great rolls of deerskin, which were very heavy. They
were hungry, but found nothing but acorns to eat. They became very weak and said:
“Our wigwams will see us no more. We shall starve, and the deerskins will never be
used.”
</p>
<p>They sat by a great rock. One of the hunters hit the rock with a stick, and a little
man appeared.
<span class="pageNum" id="pb109">[<a href="#pb109">109</a>]</span></p>
<p>The little one said: “You are starving because you killed and did not eat. You fed
the wolves; now the wolves will feed on you. We have driven the deer to another forest,
where they may live and be found by other hunters. You were selfish. You wanted all
the deerskins in the forest. You were not wise.”
</p>
<p>“What shall we do to get food?” said the hunters.
</p>
<p>“You may have meat if you will give up all the deerskins. My people have said it,”
said the little one.
</p>
<p>“We must have the skins, and we must have food. Ask your chief to let us have the
skins for our wigwams. We will be wise when we see the deer again at the salt licks,”
said the older hunter.
</p>
<p>“I will go to my chief. Hit on this rock again when you want me,” said the little
one.
</p>
<p>The Indians rapped on the rock again when the sun was setting. The little one came
and led the way to a great cave filled with food and furs. They ate and slept. At
midnight they were awakened by many of the little people, who said that the hunters
might take their packs of skins and all the food they wished from the cave if they
would never again shoot the deer to feed the wolves. The hunters promised and soon
were in a strange, sound sleep. When they awoke they were near their homes.

<p>An Indian had been out hunting all day. His arrows had never come back; they brought
him nothing; he was tired and hungry; he had no more arrows. Just then he came to
a lake on which many wild geese were swimming, and he wanted some meat. He would have
it.
</p>
<p>He saw some young saplings growing at the foot of a basswood tree. He tore off long
strips of bark from these and then dived into the lake under the geese where he saw
hundreds of their feet. He tied many of their feet together, and then fastened them
to his belt.
</p>
<p>The geese began to scream, and the flock rose from the water. He had tied six geese
to his belt; they were strong, and the geese lifted the hunter out of the water and
flew with him to the flock.
</p>
<p>He cut three geese loose; the other three broke the strings which tied them. The Indian
dropped down, down, into a tall hollow stump. He was hungry, but he went to sleep.
<span class="pageNum" id="pb111">[<a href="#pb111">111</a>]</span></p>
<p>After two days he heard squaws trying to cut down the stump; they ran away when he
called to them. The Indian men came and found him; they got him out and gave him food.
</p>
<p>The Indians gave him arrows, and he made himself a new bow; these he took and went
on a long hunt. He came to a place where there were many deer, and he had much meat
and many deerskins. The hunter remembered how the geese had carried him in the air.
He made wings of the deerskins; he learned how to fly with the wings, for the birds
taught him.
</p>
<p>The hunter was very far from his tribe. It was a long trail to his village. He said
to the birds that he would fly to his tribe, and he did. When it was night he slept
in the trees; when it was day the hunter flew until he was hungry, then he stopped
and found something to eat.
</p>
<p>He reached his village; his tribe saw him and thought a spirit had come. They called
a great council, and the hunter told his story; then he burned his wings. No other
Indian was ever seen to fly in the air.

<p>An old fox saw an Indian with a sled-load of fish. The fox wanted a fish, but was
afraid of the man. How could he get a fish without letting the Indian know? At last
he thought of a plan. He laid himself down by the sled-road and made the Indian believe
that he was dead.
</p>
<p>The Indian wanted the fox’s skin, but did not have time to take it. He threw the old
fox on the sled with the fish and pulled the big load towards his wigwam.
</p>
<p>While the Indian was hard at work pulling, the old fox pushed off two or three good
fish and rolled off himself. In a minute he was out of sight with the fish.
<span class="pageNum" id="pb113">[<a href="#pb113">113</a>]</span></p>
<p>The fox met a wolf who asked him, “Where did you get the fish?”
</p>
<p>The fox did not like the wolf, but told him the trick he had played on the Indian.
</p>
<p>“It is easy. Go and do it,” said the fox.
</p>
<p>The stupid wolf ran away, and after seeing the Indian, lay down and waited as the
fox had told him. The Indian found him, but he was not to be fooled twice by the same
trick. He pounded the old wolf with the stout stick he used for a cane. The wolf jumped
up very sore and ran away to find the fox. He did not find him.
</p>
<p>A bear saw the fox eating the fish while the wolf was gone.
</p>
<p>“Where did your fish come from?” asked the bear.
</p>
<p>“Follow that road down to the river and you will find a fishing place. Put that long
bushy tail of yours into the water. Wait until the fish bite it, then snatch them
out.”
</p>
<p>The bear ran down to the river and did just as the fox had told him, but the fishing
place froze over while the bear waited for the fish to bite. The bear did not know
this, for his back was turned to the water. It was a very cold day, and the bear thought
he would walk and get warm. He tried to get up, and his tail broke off short in the
ice.
<span class="pageNum" id="pb114">[<a href="#pb114">114</a>]</span></p>
<p>The bear ran so fast that he found the fox, and he wanted to fight him.
</p>
<p>“I have done nothing,” said the fox. “It is all because you are so slow.”
</p>
<p>The bear never had a long tail after that time. The fox never lost his fine one.

<p class="first"> big blue heron was standing in a marsh near a river. Two weasels wanted to cross
the river. The weasels talked with each other.
</p>
<p>“That is a beautiful bird,” said the mother weasel, “see how high he carries his head.”
</p>
<p>“He is as tall as a tree,” said the little weasel. “If I were as tall as he, I would
carry you across this little river.”
</p>
<p>The big blue heron was pleased, for he liked to be called tall. He was proud and could
carry his head very high, but he stooped and spoke to the two weasels.
</p>
<p>“I cannot carry you over this little river, but I will help you. You must follow me
to the end of the old tree that lies almost across the river; then I will lie down
and stick my bill in the bank, and you walk on my legs and body for a bridge.”
</p>
<p>The weasels followed the blue heron, and when he lay down they ran across over his
body to the river bank. <span class="pageNum" id="pb116">[<a href="#pb116">116</a>]</span>They were very light and quick. They did not wet their feet.
</p>
<p>An old wolf was watching them all. He wanted to cross the river, and when the blue
heron came back the wolf asked him to do the same thing that he had done for the weasels.
</p>
<p>“I have always wondered what use you were in the world. Now I see that you and your
family would make good bridges. Your long neck is very thin, but it might hold if
one were as quick as a weasel. Come, my friend, help a poor wolf that is hungry and
in trouble.”
</p>
<p>The blue heron was too proud to be used as a bridge for every one. The wolf saw that
he had not asked in the right way, so he began again.
</p>
<p>“You must be a very stout bird. Your feathers are very fine, but they cover a stout
body. My grandfather has said that two herons can carry a load of fish, but you could
carry such a load alone.”
</p>
<p>The heron looked at the wolf and told him to get up on his back.
</p>
<p>“I will carry you,” said the heron.
</p>
<p>The wolf showed all his teeth in a grin as he got on the heron’s back. The heron waded
to the middle of the stream and said:
</p>
<p>“I am only half as strong as two herons, so I can carry you only halfway. You must
wait here until you <span class="pageNum" id="pb117">[<a href="#pb117">117</a>]</span>find another heron as foolish as I am, to carry you the rest of the way.”

</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">A wigwam stood alone by a great forest. There were five people in it for a long time;
these were the father, mother, one daughter, and two sons. Before the winter was over
only the children were left, for the old warrior and his squaw had gone to the Happy
Hunting Grounds. The girl and the oldest boy promised faithfully to care for their
little brother, who was weak and suffered often from sickness.
</p>
<p>For twelve moons the older boy hunted and fished and brought food to the wigwam; then
he told his sister that he must go with some braves he had seen in the forest, and
be a great warrior like his father.
</p>
<p>“But you promised to stay until the little one was grown tall. You promised our father
and our mother.”
</p>
<p>“It is a squaw’s work to care for the children; you can do it. I am brave; I must
fight,” said the oldest brother.
</p>
<p>“You are not brave, and you have not a straight tongue. It is not well to do as you
are doing. When you go on the warpath you will lose your arrows, and your scalp will
hang to the belt of your enemy. Come back,” said the sister.
<span class="pageNum" id="pb120">[<a href="#pb120">120</a>]</span></p>
<p>The boy ran from his sister’s call into the grove of great trees. He jumped on his
pony and rode away to the band of warriors he had seen.
</p>
<p>The sister and the little brother lived together in the wigwam until the wild geese
had come and gone three times from the lake in the forest. They saw no one but the
wild deer and the other animals. They planted their corn and tried to be happy; but
the girl grew very lonely, and one day when she saw another wigwam across the lake
she felt like the young wolf they had tied to a tree near the wigwam.
</p>
<p>“Come, let us go and see who is across the lake,” she said to the little one.
</p>
<p>“I cannot walk so far; you have not made me new moccasins. I am hungry; give me more
meat,” was his answer.
</p>
<p>“You shall have much meat,” said the girl, but she was very angry. She killed the
pet wolf when the boy did not see, and made a great kettle of soup from its flesh
and the water in the lake. She put her own moccasins and her new suit on the buffalo
robe which was their bed, and while the little brother was playing at hunting she
ran away to the wigwam they had seen.
</p>
<p>“You are welcome,” said the old squaw who came out to meet her. “Where are your people?”
</p>
<p>“They are all dead,” said the girl.
<span class="pageNum" id="pb121">[<a href="#pb121">121</a>]</span></p>
<p>The squaw gave her a good supper and said, “You may live with me.”
</p>
<p>The little brother cried when he could not find his sister, and went to look for his
pet wolf. He called to it in the wolf language but got no answer. The little one ate
his soup, and putting on his sister’s moccasins lay down on the buffalo robe and went
to sleep. He hunted all day after he awoke in the morning, but could not find his
sister.
</p>
<p>“I will ask the wolves,” he said, as he heard a pack growling in the forest.
</p>
<p>He called to them in the wolf language and asked if they had seen his sister or his
little pet wolf.
</p>
<p>“We found a wolf’s head near your wigwam, and we smelled the tracks of some one that
went around the lake,” said the leader wolf.
</p>
<p>“My brother has gone, my sister has gone, my little wolf has gone; I shall starve
and freeze,” said the boy.
</p>
<p>“Come with us,” said the leader wolf; “come and be one of us.”
</p>
<p>The boy ran after the pack, and as he ran he began to chant:
</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">I am changing into a wolf.
</p>
<p class="line">The wolves are better than my brother;
</p>
<p class="line">The wolves are better than my sister.
</p>
<p class="line">I am changing into a wolf.</p>
</div>
<p><span class="pageNum" id="pb122">[<a href="#pb122">122</a>]</span></p>
<p class="first">He ran very slowly; the wolves began to howl as if some strange creature were near,
and the boy saw his own brother in a tree over his head. The older brother begged
the wolves to go away. The little one was now a wolf, and he called to the pack to
follow him, for he had found the track of a deer.
</p>
<p>The brother knew his voice and said, “Let me die, for my brother that I deserted has
become a wolf.” He fell from the tree, but the wolves did not eat him, for his little
wolf brother told them who the man was.
</p>
<p>“Let him live. He is not good enough for wolves to eat,” said the leader; but to the
brother who had done wrong life was worse than being torn by wolves. The band of warriors
deserted him in the forest, and he never went on the warpath again.

<p class="first"> boy went out to hunt and crawled into a great hole where porcupines lived. He wanted
to get some of the young ones. The dirt fell into the hole behind him and shut him
in with the porcupines.
</p>
<p>The boy cried himself to sleep, for he knew his father could not find him. When he
awoke he saw the mother porcupine as big as a squaw. She gave him some food, but he
could not eat. The food was bitter.
</p>
<p>The porcupine squaw said, “I will call a council, for I do not know what to feed you.”
</p>
<p>The council was held in the woods close by. Wolves, bears, foxes, and deer came. The
mother sent her young porcupines to call these animals to the council. The boy was
glad he had not hurt any one in the porcupine’s cave.
</p>
<p>The mother porcupine stood in the council and said: “I have found this creature in
the house I have made <span class="pageNum" id="pb124">[<a href="#pb124">124</a>]</span>for my little ones. He is hungry, but he cannot eat what my children eat. Tell me
what to give him so that he may live.”
</p>
<p>A great gray fox rose then and answered: “I live on geese and the birds of the forest.
He is the child of the red man. The red man has fire and clay. He cooks his food;
I do not.”
</p>
<p>The council decided that the fox should not take the boy.
</p>
<p>A wolf stood in the council: “I have many cubs in my den. They are always hungry.
I am always hungry. It is better for the boy never to see the place where I sleep.”
</p>
<p>And the council agreed that the wolf mother should not take the boy.
</p>
<p>The deer did not stand. His head was covered with tall antlers. He sat and looked
with kind eyes at the man-child. He said: “I have hidden my family in the thick bushes.
They are safe while I am in this council. We feed on wild grass and the tender leaves
of the trees. We love one another, but there are many who hunt us. The child could
never run as we run. Our eyes see much. We see, we hear, and we run. The child has
two feet; we have four. He could not follow us.”
</p>
<p>The council said that the deer should not take the boy.
<span class="pageNum" id="pb125">[<a href="#pb125">125</a>]</span></p>
<p>The bear rose on his hind legs and said: “I feed on nuts. My little ones are warm
and not hungry. I will take the boy.”
</p>
<p>The council said that the bear was wise. The boy should go with him, and all the other
animals would help to gather the nuts for his feeding. The council fire was put out,
and each one went home. The boy followed the bear to a hole in a great tree. The mother
bear and the cubs welcomed him, and the boy was happy.
</p>
<p>He learned to talk as the bears talk and to walk like them. Nothing hurt him, and
he was never hungry. Some Indians saw the father bear one day and chased him. Then
they found the mother and her cubs, and all were killed.
</p>
<p>The boy hid in the hollow tree. The Indians found him and took him away. He was very
wild and did not love his people, for they had killed the bears.
</p>
<p>The Indian boy was kept in the wigwam. He learned the ways of his people again, but
never did he shoot or trap a bear.

</p>
<p>An old war chief came to the wigwam of Red Eagle. The old chief wanted to marry the
young daughter of Red Eagle. He brought many furs and much food to pay for her. Red
Eagle told his daughter that this old chief was to be her husband.
</p>
<p>White Cloud was the name of the girl. She shed many tears when the war chief was gone.
She was afraid to show her dislike before.
</p>
<p>Red Eagle said: “He has brought his presents to us. We have taken them. We cannot
give them back. He is a great war chief, and we cannot offend him.”
</p>
<p>White Cloud knew that no one on earth could help her. She could not live. Her wigwam
was near the water. She jumped into her canoe, but she did not know what she was doing,
for she paddled far out into the river. The rapids were near, and the dashing water
carried her little boat down the rapids to the falls of the great waters.
</p>
<p>Hinun, the god of clouds and rain, lived under the great falls. His wigwam was behind
the falling waters. He saw the maiden in her canoe. He rushed out from <span class="pageNum" id="pb128">[<a href="#pb128">128</a>]</span>his hiding place and spread his great wings. He caught the boat before it was dashed
to pieces on the rocks, and carried White Cloud to his cave behind the falling waters.
</p>
<p>Here White Cloud lived many weeks. Hinun taught her many ways of healing. He told
her why so many of her village had sickened and had gone from earth. There was an
evil spirit under the ground on which her people lived. If she would wait in his wigwam
he would kill it.
</p>
<p>Hinun came back from watching the harvest of corn, and told her that the old war chief
was dead. She could go back to her own wigwam, and he carried her back on his wings
to the shore. She remembered the medicines he had taught her.
</p>
<p>Red Eagle was glad to see his daughter again. Her mother was sick with grief for her.
White Cloud cured her by standing beside her bed. She cured many with the new medicines.
</p>
<p>White Cloud begged of the tribe to move to a better place for their village. She told
them all that Hinun had said. They moved the village to another place, but the evil
spirit followed them.
</p>
<p>Hinun came and found the evil spirit. He struck it with lightning from the clouds.
The evil spirit was killed. It was like a great serpent, as long as twenty arrow flights.
It floated down the waters of Niagara. <span class="pageNum" id="pb129">[<a href="#pb129">129</a>]</span>Its body lodged between the rocks. It was so heavy it bent the rocks. It bent them
like a horseshoe, and they are that shape to this day.
</p>
<p>When the evil spirit was gone from under their village there was no more fever. Hinun
helped White Cloud in many ways, and she told these things to her people. Hinun does
not live behind the falling waters in these days, for when the Indians left he went
away.

</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first center">(<span class="sc">Tuscarora</span>)
</p>
<p>Chief Mt. Pleasant, of the band that has the Bear totem, tells this story:
</p>
<div class="figure floatLeft p130width"><img src="images/p130.png" alt="Stone totem." width="197" height="322"></div><p>
</p>
<p class="tb"></p><p>
</p>
<p>Many winters ago a poor, sickly old man came to an Indian village. In front of each
wigwam was placed a skin on a pole to show what totem belonged to the family. Over
some wigwams hung a beaver skin; that was the totem or sign of the tribe of Beaver
Indians. Over other wigwams hung deerskins; that was the totem of the Deer tribe.
</p>
<p>The old man stopped at each wigwam and asked for food and a place to sleep during
that night. He looked so sick that the families who had the Wolf, the Turtle, and
the Heron totems all refused him a chance to enter their wigwams.
</p>
<p>He went the whole length of the village, and at last he saw a wigwam with a bearskin
hanging over it. A <span class="pageNum" id="pb131">[<a href="#pb131">131</a>]</span>kind old squaw came out of this wigwam and brought food to him, and spread out skins
for his bed. The old man felt very sick. He told her what plants to gather in the
woods to make him well.
</p>
<p>The squaw gathered these plants and did as he told her with them; the sores on his
feet were healed and he was better very soon. She promised not to forget the secret
of the healing plants.
</p>
<p>In a few days he was taken with a fever; again he told the old squaw what plants and
leaves to go out and gather for him. She did so, and it was not long before he was
well. She promised again not to forget what she had learned.
</p>
<p>Many times he fell sick; each time it was with a new sickness. Each time he told the
squaw what to find that would heal him. The squaw learned more than all her nation
knew of medicine.
</p>
<p>One morning the old man told her that he had come to her village just to teach the
people the secrets which she now knew. No one had welcomed him but the Bear band.
</p>
<p>The old man said: “I am going away from this people now. I came to do them good. No
one but you would show kindness to the stranger. When you see the sun again, you will
find a young hemlock tree growing by the door of your wigwam. It will grow taller
than any tree that you or your tribe have seen.
<span class="pageNum" id="pb132">[<a href="#pb132">132</a>]</span></p>
<p>“This will show that the Bear tribe is the greatest. All the tribes shall come to
the Bear tribe for help in sickness. You will show them the plants, roots, and leaves
that can heal their sick people.”
</p>
<p>When the old man was done talking he went out of sight. No one has ever seen him since
that morning. The Bears have become strong, and their warriors are very brave. Their
medicine men can do more than the medicine men of other tribes.

<p class="first"> manitou lived alone in the land. Wunaumon was his name. He was brave. All the animals
feared him. He was a great hunter and the son of Menabozho.
</p>
<p>Wunaumon walked all the day through a great woods. When he came out of the woods he
saw a great prairie; it was wide, like a lake of land. Wunaumon saw trees on the further
side of the prairie.
</p>
<p>“I will see what is in that forest,” he said. His steps were long, and he was soon
almost across the prairie.
</p>
<p>Wunaumon stopped like a deer that is startled. He was not afraid, but he saw a strange
sight. A stranger came out of the forest across the prairie. He came to meet Wunaumon.
</p>
<p>“Where are you going?” said the stranger. Then he lifted a pipe of peace, and Wunaumon
took it. They were friends now.
</p>
<p>The stranger was short. He had a red feather in his scalp lock. His coat was stiff
and shiny. He did <span class="pageNum" id="pb134">[<a href="#pb134">134</a>]</span>not wear deerskin. They sat down on the prairie. They smoked the pipe of peace.
</p>
<p>“I am very strong,” said Wunaumon. “How strong are you?”
</p>
<p>“I am strong as a man,” said the stranger.
</p>
<p>“My name is Wunaumon; what is yours?”
</p>
<p>“We will wrestle. If you throw me, I will tell you my name. You will win much from
me if I fall. Let us try our strength.”
</p>
<p>Wunaumon stood up on the prairie. He was very tall and strong.
</p>
<p>“Come, Red Feather,” he said.
</p>
<p>“That is not my name,” the stranger answered. “If I fall, you shall know my name.
You shall have a great gift. You must conquer me. The gift is for all your people.”
</p>
<p>It was morning when the two began to wrestle. They were both very strong. One could
not make the other fall. They had no more breath. They stopped and began again. They
did this many times. It was a great battle.
</p>
<p>The sun began to go down. Wunaumon thought that the sun was ashamed to see his weakness.
Wunaumon put his feet very hard on the ground. He grew very fierce. His arms were
strong like the legs of a bear. There was a great noise. “Red Feather, I have made
you fall,” said he; “what is your name?”
<span class="pageNum" id="pb135">[<a href="#pb135">135</a>]</span></p>
<p>“My name is Mondahmin. My body is my gift to you. Cover me with the fine dust where
we have wrestled. Come to this place often. You will see me again. I will bring gifts
out of this prairie to your people.”
</p>
<p>Wunaumon covered Mondahmin. He went into the forest and waited one moon. He came back
to the place of wrestling. Two green feathers were waving in the air above the little
hill he had made. A voice like singing came out of the green plumes.
</p>
<p>“This is the corn, the gift of Mondahmin. Watch this plant and take the seeds to the
tribe that lives nearest you. Tell them to make a feast to Mondahmin in the Moon of
Fruits.”
</p>
<p>Wunaumon took the corn in the month of fruits. He told the tribe to keep the feast.
The gift of Mondahmin was good. It saved the people from hunger.

</p>
<p>The old chiefs tell the young men, and all who will listen, that two great spirits
rule the world. One is very good, but the other does only wicked things. The Good
Spirit made the world and filled it full of men and women. The wicked spirit would
not let one person thank the Good Spirit for his gifts to them.
</p>
<p>All tribes had much food, for there were many deer, elk, and buffalo, and the rivers
were full of fish. Water, light, and fire were given to every one; but not one gave
thanks for these things. They forgot the Good Spirit and the bad spirit was glad.
He showed them how to fight and to make war.
</p>
<p>The Good Spirit did not like to have men forget him. He lifted up the whole world
and dropped it into a great lake. All the people were drowned excepting one young
chief who had kindness in his heart. He gave thanks for his life, and a sister was
given to him, for the wigwams were empty and he was alone. He called his sister White
Earth.
<span class="pageNum" id="pb137">[<a href="#pb137">137</a>]</span></p>
<p>The young chief dreamed that five strangers came to see his sister. The Good Spirit
whispered to his heart that she must not see nor speak to one of them until the fifth
one came to her wigwam. If she did not say anything nor see them, they would give
her greater gifts than she could ask. She must not be afraid if they fell down with
no more life in them when she did not answer. But all the world would be happy if
she smiled and welcomed the fifth stranger.
</p>
<p>They came the next day. The first one was tall and wore a green blanket. White Earth
did not look nor answer him when he spoke.
</p>
<p>The stranger stood very still, and then his blanket changed into leaves, and Usama
the tobacco plant fell down to the ground.
</p>
<p>The next visitor was very short and round. He could not walk fast. The girl did not
say one word when he asked her to look at him. She did not see him, but her brother
was watching, and he laughed when Wapako the pumpkin rolled over and down the hill.
The girl was very wise and knew how to keep silent.
</p>
<p>Eshkossim the melon and Kokees the bean came together and called to White Earth the
maiden to welcome them. She did not answer, and they fell down the same as the two
who had come before them.
</p>
<p>Soon she heard a strong voice calling to her the fifth time. The girl untied the strings
that fastened her <span class="pageNum" id="pb138">[<a href="#pb138">138</a>]</span>door, and looking up she saw a very tall chief with feathers in his scalp lock. She
loved his voice, for it was like the wind in the pine trees. She said: “You are welcome,
Dahmin. I will take you to my brother. He will call you Mondahmin.”
</p>
<p>The brother gave his sister White Earth to Mondahmin, for the Good Spirit had sent
him to her.
</p>
<p>After the wedding feast a great wind came, and then much rain. In a few days the ground
was covered with the green leaves of growing plants. Usama the tobacco had come with
all of his tribe to give gifts to the great chief Mondahmin the corn plant. Wapako
the pumpkin, Eshkossim the melon, and Kokees the bean, all brought many gifts to Mondahmin
and his wife. They promised to bring the same gifts each year as long as the rains
should come and the sun give his light and make them warm.
</p>
<p>Mondahmin and his wife gave thanks to the Good Spirit. They taught their children
these things. The Indians call Mondahmin their grandfather, and they do all the things
he told them. The Indians do not forget to give thanks for the corn, bean, pumpkin,
and melon.

<p class="first">n the Southland, flat upon the ground, lies the spirit of the south wind. He is a
very fat and very lazy old man. His eyes are always toward the cool north, but he
will not stir from his resting place.
</p>
<p>When he sighs the air is filled with warm breezes. In the autumn his breath is filled
with the odor of apples and all manner of fruits. He sends the golden Indian Summer
to the Northland. Shawondasee is the name of this spirit of the south wind.
</p>
<p>One day, while looking toward the prairies of the north, he saw a beautiful girl with
yellow hair standing on the plains in the west. Every morning for days he saw this
maiden, and she seemed more lovely each day.
</p>
<p>But another morning when he opened his sleepy eyes and looked, the yellow locks on
the maiden’s head were changed to fleecy white.
</p>
<p>“Ah! my brother, the strong north wind, has been more swift than I, as he ever is.
He has put his frost crown on the maiden’s head. I will mourn for her.”
<span class="pageNum" id="pb140">[<a href="#pb140">140</a>]</span></p>
<p>Shawondasee heaved a number of warm sighs, and as the pleasant south breezes reached
the maiden the air seemed filled with tiny feathers. The maiden had vanished with
her crown.
</p>
<p>It was no Indian maiden. It was only the prairie dandelion, and the crown that Shawondasee
thought the north wind had given her was only her crown of feathery seeds; but the
lazy Shawondasee never knew the secret, and mourned for his loss and envied his brother.

</p>
<p>In a wigwam by the Falls of Minnehaha lived an Indian brave with his family. Ampata
was his wife, and two happy children played in the sunshine around his wigwam. The
little family went in the winter with their tribe farther south, and the smoke of
their village fires could be seen for many miles.
</p>
<p>Here Ampata embroidered the moccasins with colored quills and grasses; these moccasins
were for her husband and her children. Here she made the buckskin suit for her hunter.
She sewed it with strings of sinew saved from the deer whose skin she had carefully
tanned.
</p>
<p>They all went back to the north in the summer time, back to the fall of waters in
the Great Father of Waters and to the Falls of Minnehaha. There was good fishing in
these waters, and their wigwam stayed there all the summer.
<span class="pageNum" id="pb142">[<a href="#pb142">142</a>]</span></p>
<p>In the north she wove baskets of willows and baked dishes of clay. She found the red
clay and the yellow for her husband’s war paint; he was a great warrior and wore two
eagle feathers in his scalp lock.
</p>
<p>The braves of her tribe had a great battle with the Ojibways. Her husband was like
two men; he helped drive the Ojibways back to their own fishing grounds. There was
a great feast after the battle; the warriors sang and told how brave they had been.
Her husband sang a long song and made a great speech.
</p>
<p>After this he told her that he was a great warrior now and must have two wives; he
was going to marry the chief’s daughter. Ampata mourned, but he forgot her.
</p>
<p>Ampata fled to her father’s tent and took her two children with her. She went to the
south with her father when winter came; in the spring she came back to the Falls of
Minnehaha with her tribe.
</p>
<p>Her husband did not come for her, and she was alone with her children. All the warriors
went to hunt the buffalo on the prairie.
</p>
<p>There had been much rain, and the river was wide and deep. Ampata put her two children
into a canoe, and taking the paddle got in herself and pushed far out into the river.
The women called to her to come back, but she pushed away faster toward the falls.
The canoe leaped over the falls, and Ampata and her <span class="pageNum" id="pb144">[<a href="#pb144">144</a>]</span>two children passed to the Happy Hunting Ground of the other world.
</p>

<p>Every spring the Indians say that on moonlit nights they can see the shadow canoe
of Ampata leaping over the falls. They say white elk and white deer watch it from
the shore.

<p class="first">annahar, the brave chief, stood up in his wigwam before his fellow chiefs and spoke
these words:
</p>
<p class="tb"></p><p>
</p>
<p>“Brothers, hear! and with the heart keep my words. My father, Kimanchee, was a noble
chief. He was light of foot; the wind only was quicker. His strong arm was as a branch
of the mountain oak. Joy was with him when he came from hunting. His arrow never came
back without meat. The eye of my father never grew dim; his strength grew with the
days.
</p>
<p>“Kimanchee came to the council fires. He and his brother chiefs smoked the pipe of
peace. Then the warpath was overgrown with grass. Peace came like the Father of Waters;
joy like the leaping waters on the mountain. These were the blessings of Kimanchee
and his brothers. They drank at the spring in the forest and grew strong.
</p>
<p>“But where is Kimanchee, Swift-foot-of-the-prairie? The Fire Spirit came like the
clouds of the north. <span class="pageNum" id="pb146">[<a href="#pb146">146</a>]</span>Fire and death were on his wings. The shadows of darkness were before him, and the
clouds and coldness of the night fell upon his track.
</p>
<p>“The red man fell before the Fire Spirit like the leaves of the forest before the
fierce wind. Kimanchee’s eyes grew dim, his arm fell. His swift foot turned from the
hunting trail. His arrow came back to him no more. His step was like the buffalo that
has been shot.
</p>
<p>“He slept with his dog in the sun; when he stood up, his strength was gone. Kimanchee
fell. The joy that stood by the door of his wigwam stands there no more.
</p>
<p>“He fell like a tree in summer. He fell like a tree torn by lightning, with its green
leaves withered on its branches. The red man fell before the fire-water like the green
leaves of the forest before the storm wind.
</p>
<p>“This is the curse of the fire-water. Kimanchee, Swift-foot-of-the-prairie, is no
more. The Fire Spirit has taken my father. His heart is drowned in the fire-water.”

<p class="first">n the shores of Gitchee Gumee, the Big Sea Water, were many forests. Manitouwah was
a sacred grove of great trees by the water. Many pukwudjinnies, or little people,
lived among these trees.
</p>
<p>Near by was an Indian village of many teepees; in one teepee lived Leelinaw with her
father and mother. She loved the great trees. She came very often to sit in their
dark shadows and hear their leaves whisper to the blue water.
</p>
<p>One day a famous old war chief came to her father’s teepee with gifts. Leelinaw ran
to the grove, for she did not love the old war chief. Her father took his gifts, and
she was to be the old war chief’s bride. Her heart was very heavy.
</p>
<p>The stranger went away for a time. Leelinaw came back and said: “His voice and his
people are strange to me. Leelinaw will go with him, for her father commands her to
do it; but first let your child have one more day in the grove by the Big Sea Water.”
The <span class="pageNum" id="pb148">[<a href="#pb148">148</a>]</span>mother knew her child’s heart, and the father said it should be as Leelinaw had asked.
</p>
<p>She ran back to the grove and leaning against a tall tree told to it her sorrow. A
voice came to her heart from the rustling leaves. She understood the tree’s language.
</p>
<p>It said: “Lean on me, Leelinaw; I am strong. I will help you. Stay here in the pleasant
forest by the Big Sea Water. All the trees will miss you, but I love you best of all.
Stay with us forever.”
</p>
<p>The gentle voice of the leaves comforted Leelinaw. She went back to the teepee. In
the morning she dressed herself in the robe of white deerskin which her mother had
made. She took some wild rice in her hand and went away.
</p>
<p>She did not come back at sunset; then her parents believed that the war chief had
carried away his bride; but the next day he came asking for Leelinaw or his gifts.
</p>
<p>The parents called the men of the village together and searched through the forest.
The father gave back his gifts to the war chief, for Leelinaw could not be found.
</p>
<p>Three moons had gone when two Indians in their birch-bark canoe saw Leelinaw sitting
by the Big Sea Water watching them. Beside her stood a tall brave with green feathers
in his hair. The two Indians in <span class="pageNum" id="pb149">[<a href="#pb149">149</a>]</span>the boat called to the two on the shore. Leelinaw waved her hand to them. Then they
could see her no more, but two tall pines stood in the place where she and the brave
had been resting. No trees had been there before.
</p>
<p>Then the two Indians went to the village and told the father and mother of Leelinaw.
“The little people have done this thing,” said the parents. “Let us take gifts to
the two pine trees.”
</p>
<p>They did so, and the pine leaves sang sweet songs to them, but the parents thought
it was only the summer wind.

</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first center">(<span class="sc">Chippewa</span>)
</p>
<p>An Indian girl died on her wedding day. She was married to a young chief of the Chippewas.
</p>
<p>The chief was brave, but his heart was not strong enough to bear this loss. There
was no more peace for him from that hour. He went often to her burial wigwam, the
wigwam of the dead. He forgot war and hunting. He pushed aside his war club and his
hunting arrows.
</p>
<p>He had heard his people say that there was a path that led to the Happy Land of Souls.
He told his people he was going to find this path and seek this Happy Land. He made
ready his bow and his arrows. He set out on his journey, and his dog followed him.
He did not know which way to go at first. He only knew that he must go toward the
south.
</p>
<p>For a while he could see no change in the face of the country. Hills, valleys, forests,
and rivers had the same look as in his own land. There was snow when he started. He
could see it now piled thick on the trees and the bushes.
<span class="pageNum" id="pb152">[<a href="#pb152">152</a>]</span></p>
<p>At last there was no more snow. The trees were covered with buds; everything seemed
bright and cheerful. He knew that he had come to the land of spring. The air was warm;
there were no dark snow clouds in the sky. A field of blue was over his head, and
a field of green was at his feet. He saw flowers around him; he knew he was far from
the land of snow and ice.
</p>
<p>Birds sang in the trees; all signs showed him that he was on the right trail, for
he had heard his tribe tell of these things.
</p>
<p>He went on. At last the trail he was following was lost. He saw ahead of him a new
path covered with flowers; this showed that he was near the end of his journey. The
path led him through a grove, then up a long hilly ridge, at the top of which he came
to a wigwam or lodge.
</p>
<p>At the door of this lodge stood an old chief with hair like the snow on the mountain.
His eyes shone like the fire in a cave, for his eyebrows were thick and white. He
held a staff in his hands, and a long robe of skins was thrown over his shoulders.
</p>
<p>The young Chippewa began to tell his story. The old chief stopped him.
</p>
<p>“I have expected you,” he said, “and have just come to my door to welcome you. The
one you seek rested in my lodge. The sun has set but three times <span class="pageNum" id="pb153">[<a href="#pb153">153</a>]</span>since she left. Come in; when your feet have found rest I will show you where to find
her.”
</p>
<p>The Chippewa sat down in the lodge and rested. “I am ready,” he said very soon, and
the old chief led the Chippewa to the door. There they stood and looked at the great
prairies below.
</p>
<p>“That is the Land of Souls,” said the white-haired chief; “my lodge is the gateway.
Only your soul can go into that land. Leave your body here; leave here your bundle,
your bow and arrows, and your dog. You will find them all safe here when you come
back.”
</p>
<p>The Chippewa obeyed. The dog guarded his master’s burdens, while the freed traveler
leaped forward as if flying. He had no guide.
</p>
<p>Everything kept its natural color and shape, except that all things were more bright,
more beautiful than ever before. There were animals near him, but even the little
rabbit showed no fear.
</p>
<p>One strange thing he noticed from the first. His going was not stopped by trees nor
rocks, for nothing hindered him. He could go through whatever was in his path. They
were only the souls or shadows of trees. He was only a shadow himself in a land of
shadows.
</p>
<p>Soon he reached a large lake; he saw a green island in the center of it. The white-haired
chief had told him when he left the lodge that he would find this lake, and on its
shore he would meet his lost bride.
<span class="pageNum" id="pb154">[<a href="#pb154">154</a>]</span></p>
<p>He saw no one, but a beautiful canoe of shining white stone was tied to a rock at
his feet, and a shining paddle lay in it. He stepped into the canoe and lifting the
paddle turned round. He saw his bride in another stone canoe at his side.
</p>
<p>The two canoes left the shore like two white swans. Great waves came on the lake.
The white stone canoes rode on the top of the waves.
</p>
<p>The Great Manitou was good. The Chippewa and his bride reached the Happy Island of
Rest. Here they sat and talked of their happiness. They forgot that they had ever
suffered; all things made them happy.
</p>
<p>The Great Manitou talked to the Chippewa chief in a soft wind.
</p>
<p>“Go back,” said the voice, “go back to the land of the Chippewas and teach them. The
white-haired chief at the lodge at the gate will tell you many things. You have many
winters to see before you can stay here forever. Your bride will wait for you on the
Island of Rest.”
</p>
<p>The soft wind grew still. The young chief awoke. His dog was by his side. Great peace
was in the young chief’s heart,—but his journey was only a dream.
</p>
<p>He came back to his life and his work. He taught his people many things. He was very
brave. Before he died he told his people his dream, and his tribe gave him a great
name, for he had done much good to his people.

<p class="first">t seems strange that the Iroquois should have named our Big Dipper with the other
name by which we also know it. They called it the Great Bear, and pointed it out to
the white man in early days.
</p>
<p>The Iroquois have this story about the Great Bear in the sky:
</p>
<p class="tb"></p><p>
</p>
<p>Seven braves were chasing a bear, which ran from the woods to a mountain. This mountain
was the home of a stone giant; all but three hunters were destroyed by the falling
stones which he threw.
</p>
<p>The three hunters with the bear were lifted up into the sky by the spirits of the
four winds.
</p>
<p>The bear can be seen in the sky. He is followed by the first hunter, who has his bow
in his hand. The second hunter comes next with a kettle. The third hunter is far behind
them all, and he is gathering sticks.
</p>
<p>The first hunter shoots at the bear in the Moon of Falling Leaves. The red maple leaves
and the leaves <span class="pageNum" id="pb156">[<a href="#pb156">156</a>]</span>of the oak show the hurt the bear has received. After this moon the bear hides for
a time, but he comes back after a while as brave as ever.
</p>
<p>The hunter with the bow never kills him; the hunter with the kettle never cooks his
flesh; the hunter gathering sticks never builds the fire.

<p class="first">hree Ojibway hunters had been out hunting for meat many days; it was in a new place.
The woods were very thick, but there were no deer in them. The hunters had nothing
to eat; they had no water, for there was none; they were lost in the thick forest.
</p>
<p>The hunters sat down and smoked the pipe of peace. They offered the smoke to the manitous
who might live in the woods. They asked the manitous to help them. The day sun was
gone and there was no night sun.
</p>
<p>The chief covered his head with his blanket and chanted:
</p>
<p>“Our wigwams will see us no more. We will stay here forever. We can go no further.”
</p>
<p>A little pukwudjinnie came out of a hollow tree when the chief had chanted his story.
The Little One was like a little papoose, but he was very old and knew very much.
<span class="pageNum" id="pb158">[<a href="#pb158">158</a>]</span></p>
<p>He said: “I will help the hunters. I will show you the trail.”
</p>
<p>He pulled the thick bushes apart, and the hunters followed. He found the trail and
soon came upon a herd of deer feeding in the bush. The hunters shot two deer and ate
much meat; they were stronger after they had eaten the meat. The Little One did not
eat; he was not hungry.
</p>
<p>There was no rain, and the hunters had no water; they lost their strength and could
not walk on the trail. The pukwudjinnie left them; then the hunters put their blankets
over their heads and sat down. They said no words. They could not smoke the pipe of
peace, for their strength was all gone.
</p>
<p>The Little One came back with a deerskin full of drink for them; he poured it into
their mouths; it was not water; it was like no drink they ever had before. They became
very strong and wanted nothing more to eat or to drink for more than one moon.
</p>
<p>He led them on a long trail, to the land of his Little People; he took them to his
own chief. The chief was like a little papoose, but he knew all the trails in the
forest. He knew all the trails in the sky.
</p>
<p>The little chief showed the Ojibway chief the star in the north, the star that never
moves. The little chief showed them how to watch this star and not lose <span class="pageNum" id="pb159">[<a href="#pb159">159</a>]</span>their trail. He found their lost trail for them and sent them home.
</p>
<p>The three hunters came back to their own wigwams. They talked in the council and showed
their people the star that never moves.
</p>
<p>Other nations and tribes know this star now, but the Ojibways believe that their people
were the first to know where to find it in the Great Blue Wigwam, and that the Little
People were told of its worth when their home was on the Evening Star.

<div class="figure floatLeft"><img src="images/ii160.png" alt="I" width="78" height="221"></div>
<p class="first">n one tribe of the Algonquin Indians the story is told that the North Star is the
eye of Keneu, which is their name for eagle. It was also the name of a warrior of
their tribe.
</p>
<p>He had won his name by his great feats of bravery; his eyes never grew dim with sickness
nor pain; he had never shown fear. When he was taken prisoner by his enemies in war,
he had, unarmed, run the gauntlet; he had escaped when all the strong men of his enemies
had stood in two lines striking at him as he ran between the lines.
</p>
<p>Keneu had run into the wild forest, which he had never crossed before. He made himself
a war club of metikomeesh. Its seeds are set in wood cups. The black bear, or Mukwa,
feeds on the nuts when they fall. The war club was strong and heavy.
</p>
<p>Keneu crossed the wild forest; he found his own village. He sought out the wigwam
of the girl with whom he had played when they were children.
</p>
<p>When Keneu stood at the doorway of her father’s lodge, her father met him and gave
him food. Keneu <span class="pageNum" id="pb161">[<a href="#pb161">161</a>]</span>told his story and all believed him, and he asked for the maiden; he had thought of
her welcome when he should come to his home.
</p>
<p>“Memainggwah the butterfly,—where is she?” asked Keneu.
</p>
<p>“She walked the Pathway of the Spirits alone one moon before Keneu came,” said her
father; and the mother wailed a mourning cry from the place where she sat.
</p>
<p>“Keneu the war eagle will find Memainggwah. His wings are stronger than the wings
of the butterfly. Keneu will go back into the wild forest.”
</p>
<p>The warrior, who had so bravely fought his way through bands of men and hidden ways
of thick trees, gave the war cry like an eagle, then bounded back into the wilderness.
No one saw him again as Keneu the warrior.
</p>
<p>The father of Memainggwah, when crossing a marsh one night, was followed by a dancing
light as large as half the moon when it is overhead in the sky. The dancing light
seemed to call out to him. He heard it say: “I am Keneu. The Great Spirit has said
that I shall find Memainggwah, but not for many moons. Come to this place and seek
for me.”
</p>
<p>The father of the maiden went again to the soft marsh land. This time tiny lights
flitted all about him. Singing, humming, whirling, they seemed to fill the air. Wawwawtaissa,
little fire-birds, the Indians call them.
<span class="pageNum" id="pb162">[<a href="#pb162">162</a>]</span></p>
<p>One of the little living fires came and lit upon his arrows. It sang: “Watch for me.
I shall go to Memainggwah soon. The eye of Keneu the war eagle will shine through
the blue of the Great Lodge. You will see Keneu near Mukwa in the sky.”
</p>
<p>When three moons had gone the father saw a new light in the sky. It was where Keneu
had said. He took his great peace pipe and offered smoke to the new star. The star
never changed its place. It shone like the eye of a war eagle.
</p>
<p>There it has been through hundreds of moons. It is the eye of Keneu. He is happy,
for he has found Memainggwah. She waited for him halfway on the Bridge of Souls, made
by the stars which are a white pathway to the Happy Hunting Grounds.
</p>
<p>White men call this star near Mukwa the Great Bear, the North Star. It never stirs
from its place in the north. This star helps lost men to find their way back to the
trail. An Indian in his canoe at night can watch this star and know which way to go.
</p>
<p>Keneu knew what it was to seek the lost. While the North Star shines there is hope
for those who wander in the forest or on the wide lakes.

<p class="first"> little papoose was found alone in the woods by a squaw. A blind bear had killed the
child’s father, and a huge rabbit had carried off his mother.
</p>
<p>The little papoose was taken to the home of his mother’s sister. She named him Tchakobeech.
He never grew larger than a papoose, but he was as wise as an old chief. After many
moons he made snares or traps and caught the blind bear and the big rabbit, but he
never saw his mother again.

<p>Tchakobeech said: “I will go to the Happy Hunting Grounds and find my father and my

<p>Tchakobeech left the wigwam one morning and climbed to the top of the tallest pine
tree on the highest hill that he could find. No one saw him. Each time he was near
the top of the pine he blew his breath on the tree, and it grew twice as tall as it
was <span class="pageNum" id="pb165">[<a href="#pb165">165</a>]</span>at first. He did this many times, and at last he touched the blue sky. He put his
head through this blue wigwam and stepped from the tree into the Happy Hunting Grounds.
</p>
<p>Tchakobeech liked this new country very much, but he could not see any people. He
was lonesome, so he went back down the tree to the ground. He had left a sister in
his aunt’s wigwam. She was always ready to run races and to play with him. He told
his sister of the beautiful place behind the sky, and she was ready to go back with
him.
</p>
<p>The tree did not fall, and Tchakobeech made his sister climb up first, for then he
could help her if her foot slipped. He had made little wigwams on the big branches
when he came down, and they slept in these when the dark came.
</p>
<p>They had four sleeps before the sky was reached. Tchakobeech made another hole in
the sky, and after his sister had gone through it he broke off the top of the tree
and went through it himself. Nobody could follow them, for now the tree was too short.
</p>
<p>The two were very happy together and played all day in the green fields. Tchakobeech
made two wigwams and picked many flowers for their resting places. He set his traps
to see if he could catch any animals. His sister told him there was nothing to catch
in such a beautiful country.
<span class="pageNum" id="pb166">[<a href="#pb166">166</a>]</span></p>
<p>Tchakobeech heard a noise in the middle of the night and went to his traps to see
what was the matter. They were all on fire, but did not seem to burn. He called to
his sister to come and help him.
</p>
<p>The little trapper said: “Sister, tell me what I shall do. I have caught a great fire
in my traps.”
</p>
<p>The girl trembled like a leaf on a tree. She said: “I know what is the matter. You
have caught the sun. Let him go. He could not see in the dark, and his feet are caught.
He cannot get away.”
</p>
<p>The little papoose man could see that she told the truth. He was so small that the
sun burned his hands and made him blind when he tried to let it out. Tchakobeech said:
“I have made trouble for all the tribes on the ground. I am not wise any more.”
</p>
<p>Just then a little mouse jumped out of a stump. It had been with its brothers to eat
the moon. The papoose caught the mouse and breathed on it until it grew as big as
a bear. Its teeth were very long. He drove it up to the traps, and it bit the leather
strings.
</p>
<p>The sun jumped out of the snares and went away.
</p>
<p>He had been gone a whole day. All the tribes remember when the sun did not shine,
and there was no morning between two sleeps. It was many moons ago. Tchakobeech did
not put his snares in that place two times. The sun found another place to sleep and
was never caught again.

stars which they call the Old Man. White men do not always know where it is. They
tell this story of his reaching the sky, or the Great Blue Wigwam.
</p>
<p>An old chief was tired of life and of his people. He took his bundle and walking-stick
and went to the top of the highest bluff. There he sang his death chant. His people
followed, but waited at the foot of the bluff. While they were watching they saw him
slowly rise in the air; his voice sounded fainter and fainter; the spirits of the
four winds raised him to the Great Star Lodge. He was given a place among the stars.

<p>A manitou lived with his family near the Big Sea Water. There were two children in
this family of the good manitou. The children of good manitous help the Indians. They
do much good, like their fathers and their mothers.
</p>
<p>This brother and sister were told that their work would soon begin. They were to be
separated. The sister was called to go to the Place of Breaking Light. The brother
knew his work was to be a watcher among the rocks and hills. He was to be a Little
One of the Woods.
</p>
<p>The day of parting came. The sister sat with the brother and watched the sun go down
in the Big Sea Water. She put her hand into her brother’s hand.
<span class="pageNum" id="pb169">[<a href="#pb169">169</a>]</span></p>
<p>The sister said: “Watch for me, my brother; watch for me in the morning. Turn your
face to the Place of the Breaking Light when you waken from your sleep in the morning;
watch for your sister. It is our father who said I must go.
</p>
<p>“Watch where the Great Blue Lodge is painted with the paints we now see across the
Big Sea Water. I shall be in the Great Blue Lodge in the Place of Breaking Light.
My dress will be painted with paints. I will shine like a drop of the shining Big
Sea Water. Your sister will see. Your sister will watch for you. She will not forget
you.”
</p>
<p>The brother said: “I will sit on this rock in the morning. I will look toward the
Place of Breaking Light. I will watch for my sister that is gone. I will see her.
My father has said it.”
</p>
<p>The Place of Breaking Light was very bright the next morning. The red was never so
red before. All the Place of Breaking Light was bright like a burning forest. The
sun was not there.
</p>
<p>The brother saw a new star. It smiled on him like the face of his sister; he knew
her; his sister was the Morning Star in the Place of Breaking Light.
</p>
<p>“I have found my sister; she is not lost. She is in the Great Blue Lodge; the spirits
of the four winds have carried my sister. She is well.”
</p>
<p>The brother turned to go back to the wigwam of his <span class="pageNum" id="pb170">[<a href="#pb170">170</a>]</span>father, the good manitou. His feet would not carry him there. He sat down in a cave
in the rock. He saw himself in the water; he was one of the Little People. He was
glad, for he had now many brothers. They called to him in the cave; he answered them;
they were happy together.
</p>
<p>The father and mother often saw their children. The Morning Star is happy in her Star
Lodge. The brother is happy among the trees and the rocks.

that gave medicine; she could tell of things that would happen to her tribe or her
family many moons before the things came to pass; but she did not know one thing.
She did not know when this world would come to an end. She was forever asking the
Great Spirit to tell her.
</p>
<p>A manitou was sent to her to make her stop asking. She said she would stop when her
headband, which she was weaving, was done.
</p>
<p>The manitou said she must hide herself from her people or he could not answer her
question. The question would be answered when the forehead strap was finished. She
hid herself in the moon. There she sits weaving the headstrap.
</p>
<p>Once a month she stirs a great kettle of boiled corn that stands before her; while
her two hands have hold <span class="pageNum" id="pb172">[<a href="#pb172">172</a>]</span>of the stick, the cat which is always near her unravels her headstrap. She begins

to the top of a little hill near their wigwams. They would sit on this little hill
and eat their supper. When the succotash was all gone, then the best singer would
sing while the other six would dance around the mound. Every night they would do this.
No other boys came with them.
</p>
<p>One night they planned to have a feast of soup. Each boy was to bring a piece of meat.
They would cook it on the hill and then fill their clay bowls with the soup.
</p>
<p>Their parents would not give them the meat. The boys had eaten nothing all day, but
they took their empty bowls and had a mock feast. They piled their dry bowls after
this empty feast and danced around the mound.

faster than ever <span class="pageNum" id="pb175">[<a href="#pb175">175</a>]</span>before; their feet left the ground and they were dancing in the air. The six boys
were around their leader who was singing.

back. They could not do it. Whirling, floating, dancing, they took their places in

This was when animals had tribes and chiefs like the Indians.
</p>
<p>Soon after the porcupine was made head chief he called a great council. When the animals
were all seated in a ring around the council fire, he asked them this question: “Shall
we have night all the time or daylight?”
</p>
<p>Then the animals were divided. There was much talking. Some wanted it to be night
always. Some said it was best to have it always day. The bear wanted it always dark.
He had a big voice and kept chanting: “Always night. Always night.”
</p>
<p>Each animal said something. The little chipmunk had a loud voice and kept singing:
“Light will come. Light will come.” He has a loud voice yet.
</p>
<p>The council was held in the night. The animals could not decide what was best, but
the chipmunk kept <span class="pageNum" id="pb177">[<a href="#pb177">177</a>]</span>saying: “Light will come. Light will come”; and before any one knew it the sun began

</p>
<p>The Iroquois seem to have been the only nation to worship with feast and dance the
echo god of the hills. When at war with other Indian nations or tribes, the chiefs
and warriors of the Iroquois would go out and call: “Gohweh! Gohweh!” meaning, “I
am telling you!” as many times as there were enemies slain.
</p>
<p>They did this very boldly, for they never believed that strange nations could hear
or understand them or the echo’s answer. If any of their own people were slain, the
cry was, “Ohweh!” which meant, “Our own!”
</p>
<p>When they were on the warpath and night overtook them, the scattered ones were gathered
in by using the call to the echo god.
</p>
<p>While planning an attack upon some other band runners were sent out ahead to call
to the echo god and find out if it was his wish for them to fight. If no answer came
to repeated calls, the attack would be <span class="pageNum" id="pb180">[<a href="#pb180">180</a>]</span>given up for a time. Some form of worship, either feast or dance, would then be held,
and runners would after this be sent out again to ask what the echo god meant by not
answering. If by any means an answer came to their wails and calls, then the attack
would be made. If no answer came, the band found some other tribe to destroy.
</p>
<p>A dance was always given to the echo god after a victory, and with this was given
a great feast, but never until they had mourned for their dead and decided what to
do with their captives.
</p>
<p>The Iroquois go on the warpath no more. They have no longer any need to call upon
their echo god for help. They no longer offer him the worship of the feast and dance.
</p>
<p>The Northern Lights were closely watched by the Iroquois. The color of the lights
meant a great deal to the Indian watchers.
</p>
<p>If the Northern Lights were white, it was believed that the frost would shortly follow;
if yellow, sickness and much trouble to the nation was feared; while if the lights
were red, very red, war and bloodshed were on their way to harm the innocent.
</p>
<p>If the sky was mottled and it was springtime, that was the best sign possible. There
was dancing and singing, for a good corn season was expected in return for the worship
shown in the dance.

<p class="first">he spirit that rules the Woman’s Star sent her son Osseo to the earth one day.
</p>
<p>There is a little star that shines every evening near the Woman’s Star. It is jealous
of the Evening Star, and it sent poison-arrows of starlight on the head of Osseo.
When the poison light-arrow struck Osseo he became like an Indian who had seen a hundred
winters.
</p>
<p>Nothing old or evil can live on the Woman’s Star. Osseo could not return to his mother.
He was brave. He made no mourning. He made many friends among the Ojibways.
</p>
<p>Oweenee was the daughter of a chief. She was like the red lily that grows on the prairies.
She had nine sisters. They were like a field of lilies. Her sisters had each married
a great warrior.
</p>
<p>Oweenee loved the old and wrinkled Osseo. There was none to cook the deer meat his
trembling feet <span class="pageNum" id="pb182">[<a href="#pb182">182</a>]</span>brought to his wigwam. She was very sorry for Osseo. Her sisters mocked at her pity
for him. Osseo heard them one day. He took courage and asked her to help him bear
his sorrows. She became his wife, for she knew his heart was as kind as it was brave.
</p>
<p>The chief of the Ojibways made a great feast. The sacred dance was to be danced by
all the young braves. Oweenee’s sisters mocked at her again. This is what they said:
</p>
<p>“See Oweenee. She is like the young vine that clings to the pine that is black with
burning. Osseo is like the pine that the lightning has torn and burned. Oweenee would
make him like a young pine. She is blind.
</p>
<p>“Osseo, go from us. Leave Oweenee. She is not for you.”
</p>
<p>Osseo heard the sisters. His heart was very angry. His eyes looked like the eyes of
the wolverine. He looked at Oweenee and then into the sky. He gave a strange war cry
and shouted: “Sho-wain-ne-me-shing-nosa!”
</p>
<p>This means, “Pity me, my father.”
</p>
<p>“Poor old man! he is calling to his father. If he goes back, Oweenee will be the wife
of a warrior,” said the sisters.
</p>
<p>Osseo crept into a hollow log to hide himself.
</p>
<p>As quick as a bird can fly he came out of the farther <span class="pageNum" id="pb183">[<a href="#pb183">183</a>]</span>end of the hollow log, but he was no longer an old man. He was a young brave, finer
than any in the Ojibway nation.
</p>
<p>He went to Oweenee. When he put his hand upon her she became old like the oldest squaw.
Her beauty went like the lily that withers in one day. Her sisters had no words. They
sat on the ground and covered their heads with their blankets. They said, “We have
no Oweenee.”
</p>
<p>Osseo called her his Nenemoshee, his sweetheart. He fed her at the feast. He danced
the sacred dance. His eyes were always toward Oweenee.
</p>
<p>The feast was held in a great lodge. Music came into the lodge while they were all
eating. Osseo understood the music. It was his mother talking to him.
</p>
<p>“Come back to me. There is a place ready for you. Your bowls of clay shall be of copper.
Your kettles of stone shall be wampum. Come.”
</p>
<p>While they were eating the lodge was lifted into the sky. All the tribe who were eating
were changed into birds. Oweenee’s sisters became crows. Their husbands became blue
jays. Others were changed to quails and wild geese. All but Osseo and Oweenee were
birds.
</p>
<p>Osseo looked at Oweenee as they sailed through the air in the shining wigwam. She
was still an old squaw. He prayed again to his father. Oweenee became like <span class="pageNum" id="pb184">[<a href="#pb184">184</a>]</span>the lily again just as the lodge rested on the Evening Star. Here everything was peace.
All things were happy, and none did harm to another.
</p>
<p>One day the son of Osseo was learning to use his bow and arrow. He shot one of the
singing birds and a drop of blood fell on the star. The bird changed into a woman.
The child fell from the star, and the woman and all the birds followed it, down, down
to the same island they had left. The shining lodge of Osseo and Oweenee followed
them and was fastened on a high hill far out in the big lake.
</p>
<p>The land was very small there, and as the birds became men and women again, the place
was very crowded. Each one became smaller and smaller until they were the smallest
people in the world. They became pukwudjinnies.

<p class="first">n the old days all men were happy. The men and women were as happy as little children.
The wild animals came when they were called, and there was much food. The winters
were not cold; it was always like the Strawberry Moon, for the days were warm and
the nights were not cold.
</p>
<p>There were many birds in the trees. The birds were all red, blue, or yellow like the
war paint warriors now use. The birds could all sing, and there was much music. Each
tribe of the red men did what was right, and there was no war. No one knew how to
fight for a long time.
</p>
<p>The Indians sat every night outside their wigwams. They watched the stars. They said
the stars were the homes of those who had walked across the starry Bridge of Souls.
They saw a star leave the sky one night. It came halfway to the earth and stopped.
It seemed like a bird of fire.
</p>
<p>A young brave had a dream about the star, and he believed his dream. It seemed as
if the star came to <span class="pageNum" id="pb186">[<a href="#pb186">186</a>]</span>him in his sleep and looked like a white maiden. The maiden was very beautiful.
</p>
<p>She said: “I have left my home in the sky. I saw the red people and loved them. Ask
your wise men what shape I may take that I may always stay and be loved by their people.”
</p>
<p>The young brave woke and told the council. The wise men said: “Let the star choose
for herself. She may live in the top of the pine tree or in the heart of a flower.
She may live wherever she finds rest. She is welcome.”
</p>
<p>The wise men filled their peace pipes and offered the smoke of their pipes to the
star.
</p>
<p>The star came lower and made the village very light, then hid herself in the white
rose on the mountain. The star was lonely on the mountain. She could see the people,
but could not hear them talk. She left the mountain rose and went to live in a flower
upon the prairie. Great herds of buffalo went by her. The flower and the star trembled
at the sound of their hoofs.
</p>
<p>The wise men saw the star rise from the prairie. They feared it would go back to the
sky, but a soft breeze floated it over a lake. The star saw her shadow and the shadows
of her sky sisters in the water, and she rested like a canoe upon the water. The next
morning the lake was covered with water lilies.
<span class="pageNum" id="pb187">[<a href="#pb187">187</a>]</span></p>
<p>“The night stars have blossomed,” said the little children. The wise men said, “The
white star has come to live with us.”
</p>
<p>The people went out in their canoes and chanted songs to the new flower. They gave
it this name, “Wahbegwannee.” It means “the white flower.”

</p>
<p>He had only four logs of wood for his fire for the whole winter. But each log would
burn a whole moon, and as but four moons were cold, there was wood enough.

<p>Shingebis cared for no one. He liked the cold. When the wind blew the coldest he would

not fear him.
</p>
<p>“Why, this is wonderful. Here lives one who cares no more for me than I do for him.
I will try once more to see if he will give up to me.”
</p>
<p>Then came the wind from the north ten times colder than ever. Great drifts of snow
were heaped everywhere.
</p>
<p>Still the fire burned in the lodge of Shingebis. Every day he went as before and pulled
up the rushes <span class="pageNum" id="pb190">[<a href="#pb190">190</a>]</span>and reeds from the ice, and dived down for the fish which were always there.
</p>
<p>“I will go to his lodge and visit him,” said the north wind one day, as he saw Shingebis
dragging home a great fish.
</p>
<p>He went that night to the lodge by the water.
</p>
<p>Shingebis did not know he was coming. He did not care. He cooked the great fish and
ate his supper, then lay on his side before the burning log and sang a mocking song
about the north wind. It was this:
</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">Ka neej, ka neej,
</p>
<p class="line">Bi in, bi in,
</p>
<p class="line">Bon in, bon in,
</p>
<p class="line">Ok ee, ok ee,
</p>
<p class="line">Ka weya, ka weya.</p>
</div>
<p class="first">Shingebis may have known that the one he was singing about stood outside his doorway,
for he sang this song many times.
</p>
<p>The north wind could endure it no longer. He would see the creature that did not care
for his hurting. He came in and sat down opposite the loon-bird, the great Shingebis.
</p>
<p>This did not frighten Shingebis. He simply rose and stirred the coals of the fire
about the log till they blazed and sent out a great heat.
</p>
<p>“You are but my fellow creature,” kept singing the brave Shingebis, and he sat down
again in his place. <span class="pageNum" id="pb191">[<a href="#pb191">191</a>]</span>Very soon the icy tears began to flow down the cheeks of Kabibonokka. He said nothing
aloud but whispered to himself: “I cannot endure this; I must leave.”
</p>
<p>As he slipped out of the doorway not saying a word, he flew as straight as he could
to the places where the reeds and rushes grew. He froze the roots very tightly into
the ice. “Shingebis shall have no more fish,” said the ice-cold wind.
</p>
<p>Yet Shingebis found fish all that cold winter. He was brave and laughed at his trials.
</p>
<p>At last the north wind gave up trying to conquer the great Shingebis.
</p>
<p>“Some manitou is helping him. I can neither freeze him nor starve him. I will let
him alone.”
</p>
<p>When the four logs were burned and the four cold moons had passed, Shingebis still
laughed and sang in his lodge by the water.

<div class="figure floatLeft"><img src="images/im192.png" alt="M" width="195" height="215"></div>
<p class="first">any moons before the Siwashes used iron or gold or silver a strange thing happened.
It must be true, for it is told by the old men to the boys to this day. White people
do not always believe it.
</p>
<p>There lived a great Siwash hunter in the land in the west near the great river full
of salmon, where it comes into the sea. His arrows gave him much meat; his great canoe
and his spear gave him much fish. He had very many strings of shell money; the Siwash
people call it hiaqua.
</p>
<p>No one ever loved hiaqua as much as this great hunter loved it. He had many strings
of it around his neck. He was rich; but when he waited in the trees in the forest
for the elk or the deer to come that he might shoot them, he was always counting the
shells on these strings.
</p>
<p>He would say to himself: “I shall have more hiaqua than the great chief. I shall have
more than two chiefs.”
<span class="pageNum" id="pb193">[<a href="#pb193">193</a>]</span></p>
<p>When the great forest was very still his tamanous would come to him. It was like an
elk, and it would talk with him. He waited at the foot of the great white snow mountain
for the elk to come.
</p>
<p>The great mountain is called Mount Tacoma. This was the home of the Great Tamanous,
who puts only good thoughts into the hearts of all people; when the hunter sat long
in the tree and looked at the mountain he was ashamed in his heart.
</p>
<p>The Great Tamanous, who is the Good Great Spirit, seemed to ask him, “Where did you
get it, that last string of hiaqua?”
</p>
<p>And he had to say: “I tore some of the shells from the faces of helpless squaws; from
their noses and from their lips. I paid them for the shells with elk meat so dry that
they cannot eat it. I know they are starving, but they could see; they did not have
to take the meat. They could eat leaves and berries. I know there are no berries,
but they could go on the long trail and find some.”
</p>
<p>“The squaws and children were very weak with hunger,” said the Great Tamanous to his
heart.
</p>
<p>The hunter was much ashamed; in the tree by the mountain he would be ashamed, but
he never gave back the hiaqua. It was good and he wanted more.
</p>
<p>One day he went up the side of Mount Tacoma. His own tamanous came to him while he
waited; the <span class="pageNum" id="pb194">[<a href="#pb194">194</a>]</span>white elk talked to the hunter’s spirit. The tamanous said:
</p>
<p>“You are not wise. You are like the mouth of a great fish. You have great hunger,
but it is all for hiaqua. Your shoulders are covered with heavy strings of hiaqua.
You have taken the shells from the nose and lips of your own squaw. You sell her elk
meat, and she is starving like the other women. You will not feed her with the elk
meat you will get to-day. I will send her meat. I am sent by the Great Tamanous. Listen!
I will give you hiaqua enough to fill your heart.”
</p>
<p>Then the tamanous, the spirit of the great elk from which his band was descended,
told the hunter a secret. The tamanous told him of a place on the great white mountain
where was much hidden hiaqua. If the hunter would seek it and obey, he should have
enough to satisfy him.
</p>
<p>The hunter went back to his village. He told his squaw he was going on a long hunt.
He took many deerskins from his tent, and when it was very dark he went away.
</p>
<p>He made his camp that night at the foot of Mount Tacoma. He could not sleep; he could
not wait; he saw the sun rise from the top of the mountain; he had no fear. His tamanous
had said he would be with him.
<span class="pageNum" id="pb195">[<a href="#pb195">195</a>]</span></p>
<p></p>
<div class="figure p195width" id="p195"><img src="images/p195.jpg" alt="Tu-me-na. Siwash Girl" width="513" height="720"><p class="figureHead"><span class="sc">Tu-me-na. Siwash Girl</span></p>

</div><p>
<span class="pageNum" id="pb196">[<a href="#pb196">196</a>]</span></p>
<p>The hunter stood on a great rock on the top of the mountain and looked down; at his
feet was a wide hole; he could not shoot his arrow across it. The hole was white with
snow, except that in the middle was a wide black lake; across the lake he saw the
three great rocks he had been told to find.
</p>
<p>The hunter walked on the crackling snow until he reached these three rocks. He knew
them, for they were the ones his tamanous had told him to find.
</p>
<p>The first rock was shaped like the head of a salmon; the second was like the good
camass root, which all Siwashes eat; the third rock was the same as an elk. It was
his tamanous: it would take care of him; he was safe.
</p>
<p>The hunter dropped his pack of deerskin on the ground before the elk. He opened it
and took out a great elk-horn pick, and began to dig in the sand.
</p>
<p>He struck one blow in the sand. Four otters rose out of the black lake and came and
sat at the north of him. He struck the second blow. Four more otters came and sat
at the south of him. He struck the third blow. Four more great otters came and sat
at the west.
</p>
<p>The sun was bright in the east. It was watching him. No otters came and sat at the
east. These were all the guards for the place where the Great Tamanous kept his hiaqua.
They did not hurt the hunter, and he did not see them, for he was thinking only of
hiaqua.
<span class="pageNum" id="pb197">[<a href="#pb197">197</a>]</span></p>
<p>When the sun was over his head he put down his pick. He ate a bit of dried elk meat
and took his pick again. He struck a rock; it broke very quickly. He lifted up a piece
of the rock and saw a great cave full of shell money, full of hiaqua.
</p>
<p>The hunter put in his hand and played with the shells. He lifted up strings of it,
for it was strung on elk sinews. He threw the strings around his neck. He worked fast,
for the sun was moving to the west, and he knew he must go. He was strong, but he
had a great load. The sun was too fast for him.
</p>
<p>He stood up and ran, but he did not throw one string over the elk head, nor over the
camass root, nor over the rock like a salmon. He turned his back on the great otters.
He did not offer them one string, not one shell; he forgot his promise to the Great
Tamanous. He did not obey.
</p>
<p>He ran on with his great load of hiaqua. He reached the white snow on the side of
the great pit; then all the otters jumped into the black lake and lashed it into white
foam with their bodies and tails. A black mist came over the mountain; the storm winds
came. The Great Tamanous was in the storm.
</p>
<p>The winds blew the hunter from one side of the wide hole to the other side. He had
his hands on his money and did not lose one string. The water helped the winds to
throw him back to the great rock on the top <span class="pageNum" id="pb198">[<a href="#pb198">198</a>]</span>of the mountain. The hunter did not let the otters get one hiaqua.
</p>
<p>He heard two voices in the thunder; one was the Great Tamanous. He heard the tamanous
of all the mountain scream to him in the wind; he heard them laugh.
</p>
<p>His body was like a leaf, as the winds blew him and tossed him from one rock to another.
They did not break a string; they did not take his hiaqua. He did not give them one
shell.
</p>
<p>The night was two days long; he broke one string and threw it away to the winds. They
laughed. He threw another string to the thunder voices. The thunder was heavier than
before. He threw away every string of hiaqua; then his body dropped on the ground
on the side of the mountain, and he went to sleep.
</p>
<p>When his eyes came open he was hungry; he dug some camass root, and made a pipe and
smoked. His bones were not broken, but his joints made a noise like a paddle on the
edge of a canoe. His hair was like a blanket on his back; it lay on the ground while
he was smoking.
</p>
<p>“The Great Tamanous has done this,” said the hunter. He looked at the white mountain,
and his heart was full of peace.
</p>
<p>“I have no hiaqua. It is all given back to the Great Tamanous. I am well. I have no
hunger for it. I will go home.”
<span class="pageNum" id="pb199">[<a href="#pb199">199</a>]</span></p>
<p>He found the trail overgrown with tall trees.
</p>
<p>“Tamanous has done it,” he said.
</p>
<p>The people in his village did not know him. He asked for his wife, and they pointed
to an old squaw, wrinkled and with her face bent to her knees. She knew him and pointed
to his hair.
</p>
<p>“Tamanous,” he said.
</p>
<p>“There is the little papoose,” she said. The papoose was a man with white hair.
</p>
<p>“He is your son and my son,” said the old squaw.
</p>
<p>The hunter looked in the water. “I have slept for many moons,” he said.
</p>
<p>He became a great medicine man, for he was wise. He taught the Siwash nation many
things. He taught them to keep their promises. He told them not to forget the Great
Tamanous whose home is on the white mountain.

<p class="first center">(<span class="sc">Iroquois</span>)
</p>
<p>An Indian was alone in the thick woods when he heard a strange sound, and looking
sharply through the branches and leaves saw a large bird. It had no feathers. It was
covered with wampum.
</p>
<p>The warrior made no noise. He ran back to the village and told his chief. He was believed,
for no one dared to tell false things to the chief.
</p>
<p>A great council was called. The warriors were told that whoever should bring the bird
into the camp would win a great prize, and that prize was the daughter of the head
chief.
</p>
<p>A hundred warriors took their bows and arrows and went softly to the thick woods where
the wampum-bird was resting. It had flown to the top of the tallest tree. They knew
it was a spirit bird that had lost its way.
</p>
<p>Many arrows hit the bird, and many strings of fine wampum fell to the ground. Some
picked these up <span class="pageNum" id="pb201">[<a href="#pb201">201</a>]</span>and ran away, for they were rich now, and did not care for the prize; but, when they
reached the village, the wampum turned to turkey feathers in their hands. They hid
themselves in their wigwams. They were ashamed of their greed.
</p>
<p>The warriors who stayed and shot at the bird gave great war whoops, but the bird did
not fly away, nor was it frightened at any noise they made.
</p>
<p>A little Indian boy from another tribe was hunting in the woods. His father had been
killed in battle. His mother was hungry, and he had gone out to get meat for her.
He heard the war whoops of the warriors, but he was not afraid. He came and watched
them shoot at the bird.
</p>
<p>“Let me shoot,” said the little boy. The warriors were very angry, but the head chief
said, “Let him shoot.”
</p>
<p>The warriors waited, and the boy shot his arrow. The bird fell to the ground close
by the boy. He gave the splendid wampum-bird to the head chief.
</p>
<p>The boy was married to the head chief’s beautiful daughter the next day. He was now
a chief’s son, and his own mother was hungry no more.
</p>
<p>His father had been slain by the head chief’s warriors. The boy chief made a law that
wampum should be the price of peace. When war was to be declared the tomahawk should
be painted on a belt of wampum; <span class="pageNum" id="pb202">[<a href="#pb202">202</a>]</span>it should be sent to the tribe they would fight against; when the war was over the
two tribes should exchange belts of wampum as promises of peace.
</p>
<p>The head chief sent a wampum belt to the boy chief’s tribe; then they had peace.
</p>
<p>This is the story the tribes tell of how wampum came to be used for war and for peace.

<h2 class="main"><span class="divNum">XL.</span> THE MAGIC MOCCASINS</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first center">(<span class="sc">Chippewa</span>)
</p>
<p>An Indian hunter shot at a moose, but his arrow missed and took the life of another
hunter, the brother of Wahkandee the Lightning.
</p>
<p>Mukwa, who had made the fatal shot, wore a pair of wonderful moccasins. A manitou
had prepared the leather in the moccasins for himself. The manitou had whispered many
secrets to the leather; but he gave it all to the hunter’s wife because of his love
for her husband.
</p>
<p>Wahkandee, the avenger, came into the forest where Mukwa, the moose hunter, was hiding.
He saw the feathers in Mukwa’s hair and shot his arrows to avenge his brother. He
heard the dry bushes crackle and crept to the place where Mukwa had been. There lay
a pair of fine moccasins and many dry moose bones.
<span class="pageNum" id="pb205">[<a href="#pb205">205</a>]</span></p>
<p>“I will take the fine moccasins. Mukwa will want them. I will find him.”
</p>
<p>Wahkandee reached down to take the moccasins, but they slipped away from his fingers.
The moccasins fled across the lake, and Wahkandee followed in his canoe. They crept
through the thick brush in the forest on the shores of the lake. Wahkandee followed
like the swift feet of Skika the wood duck.
</p>
<p>The thorns tore his buckskin suit, but he never stopped in the chase. The moccasins
seemed to be always within the reach of his hands, but he could never touch them.
Wahkandee thought that the black cloud at the edge of the earth would stop the race;
when he reached the place of the black cloud, it was gone. The moccasins were always
before him.
</p>
<p>A great mountain was in sight. Wahkandee followed the flying moccasins over rocks,
roots, and crumbling stones. When going down the further side of the mountain he saw
a beautiful white wigwam. All footprints seemed to come away from it. None went toward
it. The moccasins had disappeared, and Wahkandee said, “I will rest.”
</p>
<p>The white wigwam rested on the stump of a great pine tree. The wigwam had two doors:
one in front and one at the back. Two Indian girls sat back to back in the middle
of the white wigwam, each looking out of a door.
<span class="pageNum" id="pb206">[<a href="#pb206">206</a>]</span></p>
<p>“What is your name?” Wahkandee asked the girl who sat at the front door.
</p>
<p>“My name is ‘The-one-who-sees-all-things-to-come,’ ” said the girl.
</p>
<p>“Have you seen the one who owns the flying moccasins?” asked Wahkandee.
</p>
<p>“I look before. I cannot tell what has gone,” said the maiden.
</p>
<p>Wahkandee walked to the other door and faced the other Indian girl.
</p>
<p>“What is your name?” he asked.
</p>
<p>“My name is ‘The-one-who-sees-all-things-that-have-gone.’ ”
</p>
<p>“Can you see the hunter who slew my brother?” asked Wahkandee.
</p>
<p>“I can only see moose bones lying on the ground. You are hungry. Take the moose meat
that hangs here on the trees and eat. Our father will make you welcome. You can see
his bow and arrows. He will come. You can sleep by the bones of the moose.”
</p>
<p>While Wahkandee slept the wigwam was lifted from its place and it floated away. The
stump stretched out its arms and became a great manitou. The magic moccasins had changed
into the maidens. They now became moccasins again. One was turned toward the east,
and one toward the west.
</p>
<p>The manitou touched the dry bones of the moose. <span class="pageNum" id="pb207">[<a href="#pb207">207</a>]</span>The lost hunter stood before him. He put on his moccasins. The manitou touched Wahkandee,
and he became like the dry bones of the moose. He never woke from his sleep.
</p>
<p>The manitou turned the hunter’s head toward his home in the north. The magic moccasins
carried him home. He went as the wild bee goes back to its tree. The hunter told the
story of his moccasins around the council fire.
</p>
<p>The women tried to learn from his wife the secret of their making. She told them how
she colored the quills for the patterns she made on the leather. She told them how
she sewed them with sinew. This the women could see; but they could not see that her
fingers had been warm with love for her husband when she wove the quills into the
leather and when she sewed it with the sinew.
</p>
<p>The women could not know the secrets the manitou had whispered to the leather; nor
did they know of the love the manitous have for those who try to please them. This
was why the hunter was saved when he did the wrong that was not in his heart to do.
All the squaws have tried to make magic moccasins, but only Mukwa has ever worn them.

<p class="first"> great hunter among the Chippewas, or Ojibways, wanted his son to secure a powerful
spirit to protect him in war and all danger. To gain the help of the strong manitou
the boy must fast twelve days.
</p>
<p>Many Indian boys can do this, but not all. Many try and fail.
</p>
<p>The boy did as his father commanded, for when the time came he went into the secret
lodge in the deep forest and laid himself down alone on the mat his mother had woven
for him. He did not fear, but his strength was weak. All night he lay there alone.
</p>
<p>In the morning his father came and asked him if the strong spirit had come to him
in his dreams. The boy shook his head. No dreams had come to him.
</p>
<p>Each day for ten days the father came to the little lodge in the wilderness and asked
his son if the strong manitou had come to him.
</p>
<p>“It is not for me to have such dreams, my father. I am not brave. The strong manitou
will not come to me. Let me give up my fast.”
<span class="pageNum" id="pb209">[<a href="#pb209">209</a>]</span></p>
<p>“If you give up now, the manitou will never come. Hunger makes my son weak, but his
heart is strong. It is only a short time more to wait. Then my son shall be the strongest
of all.”
</p>
<p>The Indian boy covered his face and lay still upon the mat. He would obey his father.
The morning of the eleventh day the boy saw his father enter the wigwam. He slowly
turned his face toward him and whispered: “Let me break my fast; I have no dreams.”
</p>
<p>“To-morrow I will bring you food. To-morrow you shall come to the lodge of your father.”
</p>
<p>The boy closed his eyes and said no more. He was very weak and faint.
</p>
<p>The next morning the father went with the earliest morning light to the little lodge
in the forest. Peeping through the door he saw his son sitting up. Beside his mat
were brushes and paint. He was painting himself red and brown.
</p>
<p>“The manitou will free me, but it is not the spirit my father wanted,” he heard the
boy say.
</p>
<p>The father rushed into the lodge, but as he touched his boy the lad changed into a
bird and flew out of the open doorway. Sitting on the top of the lodge he sang these
words:
</p>
<p>“Do not mourn for me, my father, for I am happy. I did not want to be a warrior. I
wanted only to be <span class="pageNum" id="pb210">[<a href="#pb210">210</a>]</span>free. I shall find food upon the fields and the hills. I will comfort you.” Then he
flew away.
</p>
<p>Opechee lives near the homes of men. He loves to comfort them when they are sad. He
is happy when they are happy.
</p>
<p>His songs are for the little children and for the fathers and mothers who want their
little ones to be brave. Opechee is not afraid in the storm, and many have heard him
singing just after the great thunderbirds had called to each other and the water was
coming fast from the sky to find a place to hide in the ground. Opechee is brave,
but not strong.

<p class="first">ne of the warriors in an Ojibway band had a boy who refused to fast as all other boys
and men had done.
</p>
<p>“I like to eat; it is hard to be faint and hungry,” said the boy when his father took
him to the little wigwam in the forest.
</p>
<p>“You shall eat after the manitou has talked to you,” said the father.
</p>
<p>“I will not fast; let me have my bow and arrows and I will hunt for you,” said the
boy.
</p>
<p>“If you will not go into the little wigwam, you shall not come back to my fire. You
may sleep where you can find a place, but never come back to me until you have talked
to a manitou,” said the warrior.
</p>
<p>The boy ran into the forest and hid himself. He picked berries all day and made a
bed on the moss at night. The moon shone very bright, and he thought there was a face
in it, so he asked the moon to take care of him while he slept.
<span class="pageNum" id="pb212">[<a href="#pb212">212</a>]</span></p>
<p>The boy awoke, but it was not day. A girl stood by him dressed in shining clothes,
and her face was like the one he had seen in the moon.
</p>
<p>“I shall have to go back to my sky teepee, but you must go with me. Stand up quickly
and take hold of my hand. Come, Cloud Catcher, come, for the stars are going to hide,”
and the boy felt himself rising and moving through the air like a bird.
</p>
<p>Cloud Catcher went through the clouds into the beautiful country behind the sky, and
soon they stopped in front of a great teepee which belonged to a great chief with
hair like fire. The chief was the moon maiden’s brother.
</p>
<p>“You are not wise,” said the great chief to the girl.
</p>
<p>“I am alone; let me have him and I shall be happy,” said the moon maiden.
</p>
<p>The chief gave the boy a pipe and a bow and some arrows. “You may stay,” said the
sun chief.
</p>
<p>Cloud Catcher and the girl played in the fields all day while the sun was off on his
journeys. He shot at the stars, and sometimes hit one so hard that it let go and fell
down through the sky. The moon maiden had a great bow that she hung in the sky at
night and played with in the daytime. She could shoot farther than Cloud Catcher,
but she never hurt anything with her arrows.
<span class="pageNum" id="pb213">[<a href="#pb213">213</a>]</span></p>
<p>One day the boy went to the great sun chief and said: “I used to eat much when in
my father’s wigwam. I am hungry for meat; will you give me some?”
</p>
<p>“You children of the ground are very strange in your ways,” said the sun chief. “You
have all the sky to make you happy, but now you are crying for meat. It is not wise,
but you shall have it, for you are one of us, and whatever you ask must be given.
Come with me.”
</p>
<p>The sun chief took Cloud Catcher the next day, and they walked to a place where the
sky was open. They looked down on the ground, and the chief shot one of his arrows.
It struck a little child, who fell down and was carried into her father’s wigwam.
</p>
<p>“Send meat and the child shall be well,” said the sun chief. Meat was put on the fire
and burned, and as it burned it came up to Cloud Catcher’s feet, and he ate it like
a hungry man. The child walked out of the wigwam, for it was now well, and Cloud Catcher
had his meat. After that feast he wanted to walk many times with the sun to the place
where the sky was broken, and every time he asked for meat.
</p>
<p>One day he said: “I will go back to my own country; there my arrows will bring my
meat to me, and no one will need to be sick.”
</p>
<p>The moon maiden said: “You are going back to sickness, to cold, and to war, but you
belong to me and must never take a wife from your people. Come,” and <span class="pageNum" id="pb214">[<a href="#pb214">214</a>]</span>again they moved through the air like birds. She took him back to his bed of moss,
and when he awoke this time he found his father standing by him.
</p>
<p>“I have seen a manitou; I am to be called Cloud Catcher,” said the boy, as his father
took his hand and led him into their wigwam. His mother was glad to see him and very
proud of his name.
</p>
<p>“You are tall; you are strong and brave. There is no one in the tribe like you. Where
have you been?” asked the mother. The boy told only a little, for it seemed like a
foolish dream, and he was afraid no one would believe him.
</p>
<p>“I fasted many days, my father; then I ate strange food that came to me. I am a man
now. My mother is wise; she will not ask any more,” and Cloud Catcher kept very quiet
with his tongue.
</p>
<p>He grew very lonely, and after a time he found a wife who cared for his wigwam and
cooked his food for four days, then she was gone; no one ever saw her again. He married
the second wife, but when she, too, left him he remembered the moon maiden’s words,
and went out in the moonlight and lay on a bed of moss. When he awoke he was floating
through the air, and the sun chief called to him to stop at his teepee. There he found
the girl whose face he had watched so many nights in the moon, and he never came back
to earth.

<h2 class="main">INTRODUCTORY—THE INDIANS’ PRESENT CONDITION</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<div class="figure floatLeft"><img src="images/it217.png" alt="T" width="551" height="281"></div>
<p class="first">he present condition of the Indians is very different from that when the tribes roved
for thousands of miles either in pursuit of enemies or for food.
</p>
<p>Now they are prevented by law from fishing or hunting outside the boundaries of their
various reservations, to which they were sent by the government for different reasons.
For many years meat and flour were given to some tribes as rations at certain periods
of the year, when they also received money and blankets. A number of tribes have become
much like the white man, and live in houses and have large numbers of horses and cattle
upon the plains or on their farms in the east; other tribes, proud of their ancient
customs, still try to live as nearly as possible in the way of their ancestors.
<span class="pageNum" id="pb218">[<a href="#pb218">218</a>]</span></p>
<p>Their love for their nation, tribe, and family is very great, and that is one reason
why a few of the Indian students become once more Blanket Indians. They cannot endure
the taunt that they have forgotten their own people.
</p>
<p>The old myths of years ago are repeated in Indian homes, and many of the stories,
like those told in the poem of <i>Hiawatha</i>, are familiar tales to little children in western teepees. Hiawatha the Wise we now
know is an Iroquois hero; Menabozho, who is called the Foolish or Sly One, is an Algonquin
hero, and they are two very different characters in the lore of two different Indian
nations. Hiawatha the Iroquois is always dignified; Menabozho the Algonquin is very
powerful but full of boyish tricks.
</p>
<p><span class="sc">Menabozho, or the Great White Hare</span>
</p>
<p>From the east side to the west side of America the Algonquin Indians all have their
stories of Menabozho. When the story is of some great deed of Nanabush, or of Missaba,
you must remember that these names are only another way of speaking of Menabozho.
In the different Indian tribes the languages are different; but those who have been
most among these many tribes of red men find that nearly all have some name for this
Great Manitou, or Spirit.
<span class="pageNum" id="pb219">[<a href="#pb219">219</a>]</span></p>
<p>Whatever was the first cause of their belief in such a being, there is no way of knowing.
All people, no matter how wild, believe in God; but the wilder the people the more
gods they believe in. It is so with the Indian.
</p>
<p>The red man seemed to believe every stone, every bush, and almost every animal had
its manitou or spirit. These manitous were something to be feared, and to which prayer
ought to be offered. So we will call them the gods of the Indians. But these gods
were ruled over by greater ones that had wonderful powers.
</p>
<p>The Indians watch the sun, moon, and stars a great deal and know much more about them
than many white people who have no time for such study. When they saw the power of
the sun in bringing life out of the earth in the shape of growing plants from hidden
seeds, then the sun seemed like a living spirit to them.
</p>
<p>The name Menabozho has been found to mean in the Indian language the Great White Hare.
It has been found to mean more than that. Some one who has studied into the meanings
of Indian words says that it means the “god of light,” or “ruler of the sun.” When
you read marvelous stories of Menabozho remember then that the Indians who told these
tales first had in mind one of their strong gods,—one who was swift and powerful as
the light of the sun; one who was <span class="pageNum" id="pb220">[<a href="#pb220">220</a>]</span>as kind as the sun is to the earth, bringing food and blessing to every one.
</p>
<p>The sun hides away every night; so Menabozho often rested. The sun is often troubled
by clouds and storms; and Menabozho has many troubles, but usually comes out very
bravely from every hindrance.
</p>
<p>This manitou could take many forms. He very often appeared upon the earth as a man,
for that is the highest form of all life. He is said to have many homes.
</p>
<p>Some say Menabozho’s home is in the east. He rules over the east wind and watches
the sun that it may follow the right path through the sky. He rules the sun. It could
not leave the east without him.
</p>
<p>The Indians in some nations have a kind of picture to represent Menabozho. It looks
something like a child’s picture of a rabbit. People have thought of many reasons
why the red men should have called him the Great White Hare. The Indians themselves
do not seem to explain why they did it.
</p>
<p>We know from many Indian customs and from their records, for they have kept many records,
that the red men lived in America for hundreds of years before Columbus came. Where
the first Indians came from the most learned white man cannot tell. He can only guess.
</p>
<p>Some of the Indian stories tell that the red man was <span class="pageNum" id="pb221">[<a href="#pb221">221</a>]</span>created here in America. That is not strange for them to say, for they have no remembrance
of another land. If they came from across the great ocean at the west, or drifted
across the one at the east, they may have brought this story of Menabozho, the god
of light, with them. Early travelers found some tribes expecting the Great Spirit
to come among them again in the shape of palefaced men. The same belief was found
far south in Mexico. It seems very strange to us. Many have thought that it was the
coming of Menabozho the red men expected when the white men came.
</p>
<p>This same Great Spirit who was to come was kind and good. He would be a brother to
all creatures, man and beast. Menabozho called everything his brother. Stories that
the Indians are telling of him to-day speak of him as calling the trees his brothers.
</p>
<p>Those who are much among the Indians now, as the hunters in the northern forests are,
tell of how real this kindly manitou is to the red man in his every-day life.
</p>
<p>There is a certain little black swimming bird that looks much like a duck, which is
called a diver. When this bird rushes from the reeds by the river into the water,
the Indian who sees it often cries out, “There goes the bird Menabozho kicked.”
</p>
<p>If the white fisherman tells a story of some great fish that he has caught, or that
nearly came into his <span class="pageNum" id="pb222">[<a href="#pb222">222</a>]</span>net, then the Indians, among themselves, grunt and scoff at his story. They can tell
of a larger fish than any white man ever saw or brought to shore. Menabozho sailed
into its mouth in his canoe. And so this same being is as real to them as any we have
learned of in our childhood’s days.
</p>
<p>The stories recently collected are interesting in showing how alive is all Nature
to those who live nearest to her. The Indian still seems to understand with the heart
of a poet the voices of trees, stones, and brooks. We are glad to know that many whites
have learned that the red men have a strong love for justice and truth and can show
mercy to those who have been merciful.
</p>
<p>The Indian is not a dull-minded being. His wits are keen, and his judgment as fine
as many a civilized man can claim. But he lives a life far apart from the busy city
or town life of the white man, and it is hard for each to understand the life of the
other.

</div>
<div class="divBody">
<div class="figure floatLeft"><img src="images/it223.png" alt="T" width="223" height="225"></div>
<p class="first">he Indians tell that, in a time so long ago no one can tell when, four brothers were
born on this earth.
</p>
<p>The first was Menabozho, who is the friend of all the human race. The second was Chibiabos,
who cares for the dead and lives in the Country of Souls. The third was Wabose. He
ran far away to the north and was changed into a rabbit, but is still very powerful.
The fourth was Chokanipok, the Man of Flint.
</p>
<p>Menabozho did not love his fourth brother, the stone man, and had many battles with
him. These battles were long and terrible. Traces of them can be found to this day.
Chokanipok’s body was as large as a mountain. In one of these battles Menabozho’s
arrows tore off many pieces of flesh from him. These changed into flint stones when
they touched the earth, and men made fire by striking two of them together.
</p>
<p>At last Menabozho conquered, for he had more love for man in his heart than had his
brother, and the <span class="pageNum" id="pb224">[<a href="#pb224">224</a>]</span>great firestone giant fell, and his pieces are scattered everywhere.
</p>
<p>This gave Menabozho courage, and he traveled all over the earth teaching men how to
use stone and bone. He taught them how to make stone axes. He showed them how to make
snares and traps so as to catch fishes and birds. He taught the women how to weave
mats and beautiful baskets.
</p>
<p>While he traveled he saw the huge creatures whose bones are now dug up from far under
the ground. Menabozho slew these animals himself and hid them away. He opened the
pathway for the rivers between the hills and mountains. He made the earth ready for
the Indian.
</p>
<p>Menabozho placed four spirits at the four sides of the heavens. The spirit which he
put in the north sends snow and ice so that the Indian may hunt during the cold moons.
The spirit in the south sends the warm wind and gives the red man corn, melons, and
tobacco. The spirit that stands in the west sends the rain, and the spirit in the
east gives light to the earth.
</p>
<p>Some Indian legends say that Menabozho now lives on an ice mountain in the great sea.
If he, by any chance, were driven from his home all things would burn if he should
touch his feet to the ground to spring into the air. The end would come, for the <span class="pageNum" id="pb226">[<a href="#pb226">226</a>]</span>sun could never shine again without Menabozho to guide it from the east to the west.
</p>

</p>
<p>When this great manitou walked on the earth his steps measured as long as the steps
one tribe would take in one day. He could step over mountains and think they were
only ant-hills. He could step over a large lake. If he wished, he could make himself
as short as a man. He had great power.
</p>
<p>It is told that a little child once outwitted him. The boy was playing outside his
mother’s lodge and dared the manitou to do as he did. The manitou loved the child
and waited to see what it did. The boy lay down and put his toe into his mouth. Menabozho
tried to do this same thing and could not.
</p>
<p>He told the boy to wish for anything and that he should have it. The boy wished for
long life. Menabozho changed the child into a white-cedar tree, and the tree stood
for hundreds of winters in the place where the child had stood when he wished for
long life. It was not far from where he lay by his mother’s wigwam when he dared the
great Menabozho to a deed the manitou could not perform.
</p>
<p>It was in this way the wise manitou punished the boy. It is not well for any one to
be wiser than a manitou, for even the flint stones show that these spirits are very
powerful.

<p class="first">enabozho, the great land manitou, did not like the water manitous or spirits. One
day he saw the chief of the water manitous asleep on a rock, and he shot and killed
him with a magic arrow; then the little water manitous called the big rivers to help
them and chased Menabozho up a high hill.
</p>
<p>The water reached halfway up the hill; the water manitous called all the little rivers
then to help them. The water chased Menabozho to the top of the high hill. He climbed
up a tall pine tree, but the water came up to his chin; it could not go over his head,
for there is not water enough in the whole world to drown the great Menabozho.
</p>
<p>He waited a long time while he stood on the top of the pine tree. The rivers would
not go back, and he could not see any land.
</p>
<p>A loon flew over his head and then dived into the great water. Menabozho said: “Brother
Loon, come <span class="pageNum" id="pb228">[<a href="#pb228">228</a>]</span>to me. I must make land for us to stand on. Will you dive down and bring me a little
sand?”
</p>
<p>The loon put down his head and went through the deep water, but it was too deep even
for the great loon-bird. He came up again, but he had left his breath in the deep
water. Menabozho caught him as he floated by the pine tree, but he found no sand in
his bill nor on his feet.
</p>
<p>An otter put his head out of the water close by Menabozho.
</p>
<p>“Brother Otter, dive down and bring me up a few grains of sand. We must have land
to put our feet upon.”
</p>
<p>The otter knew he must do as Menabozho told him, so he put his head down into the
deep water. He came up, but he had no life any more, and Menabozho could not find
any sand in his paws.
</p>
<p>A muskrat came swimming by just then. “Brother Muskrat, you are very brave. Will you
dive down to the sand under this deep water and bring me a few grains? I must make
land for my brothers,” said Menabozho.
</p>
<p>The muskrat was brave, for he dived down, but he came up just like the otter. He had
no more life, but he had a little sand in one front paw.
</p>
<p>Menabozho held the sand in his own hand and dried it in the sunshine. He blew it with
his breath far out <span class="pageNum" id="pb229">[<a href="#pb229">229</a>]</span>on the water, and it made a little island. Menabozho called the sand back to him.
He dried it in his hand again and then blew it to its place on the deep water. He
did this for two days, and the island grew larger every time it was sent back. Menabozho
left the tree and walked on the land.
</p>
<p>He called to his brothers, who are the trees, animals, and everything on the land,
to come and live on this land. The water had to go back to its place.

<div class="figure floatLeft"><img src="images/im230.png" alt="M" width="289" height="259"></div>
<p class="first">enabozho killed a large moose when hunting. He put the meat in boxes made of birch
bark and hid the boxes by a sweet-water tree, which the white men call a maple tree.
</p>
<p>There was much moose meat, and it would last many weeks. There was much moose fat,
so Menabozho made more birch-bark boxes and hid the fat in them near an oak tree.
He hung the mooseskin in the branches of the tree.
</p>
<p>Menabozho sat on the ground and ate much moose meat; while he was eating he heard
a noise over his head and saw that two trees were pulling each other. A tall tree
had fallen into the top of a small tree, and it was caught. The wind tried to pull
the tall tree away, but the little tree held it tight, and the branches made a noise
like something alive. Menabozho did not like to hear such a loud noise when he was
eating.
<span class="pageNum" id="pb231">[<a href="#pb231">231</a>]</span></p>
<p>He climbed into the little tree and tried to pull the tall tree away. His arm was
caught between the two trees, and he was like a bear in a trap. The two trees pinched
Menabozho’s arm very hard.
</p>
<p>While he was in the trap trying to get loose, a wolf came along under the trees; she
had two young wolves with her.
</p>
<p>“Look out!” said Menabozho; “don’t go near that sweet-water tree. There is nothing
for you in these woods.”
</p>
<p>The old mother wolf knew Menabozho and his tricks. She found the birch-bark boxes
and called to her little ones.
</p>
<p>“Come down and eat, Brother Menabozho,” said the old wolf. She knew she was safe,
for the trees held him close.
</p>
<p>The wolf and her young ones played with the empty boxes when the meat was gone; they
broke them all, then ran toward the oak tree.
</p>
<p>“Don’t go there; the tree may fall on you!” said Menabozho.
</p>
<p>“Come, children,” said the wolf, “use your noses and you will find more food.”
</p>
<p>They found the moose fat in the other boxes. Wolves can eat all the time. These wolves
ate up the sweet moose fat, and Menabozho fought with the trees to get out of the
trap they made for him. He <span class="pageNum" id="pb232">[<a href="#pb232">232</a>]</span>tried to pull up the tree he was in by the roots, but he could not do it with one
hand.
</p>
<p>When the wolves were done eating, a great wind came and blew the trees apart. Menabozho
came down the tree very fast, but the wolf and her young ones were very strong from
their good dinner. They ran away where no one could find them.
</p>
<p>Menabozho liked to play tricks on everything. He did not like it when they played
tricks on him, and now he had no meat nor fat. There was only the moose head left.
</p>
<p>He put his head into the moose head to eat the meat. He could not get out, and there
he was caught again in a trap, and this time he could not see, but he could use his
arms and feet.
</p>
<p>“I don’t care,” said Menabozho. “It is a good trick. I will get away.”
</p>
<p>He ran against a tree. Menabozho put his arm around the tree and said: “What is your
name, Brother Tree?”
</p>
<p>“My name is White Oak,” was the answer.
</p>
<p>“White Oak does not grow near water; I must go further,” said Menabozho.
</p>
<p>Soon his moose head struck another tree. “O my brother, what is your name?” asked
Menabozho.
</p>
<p>“My name is Basswood,” said the tree.
</p>
<p>“Basswood grows near water,” said Menabozho.
<span class="pageNum" id="pb233">[<a href="#pb233">233</a>]</span></p>
<p>He ran along a little further and fell over the bank into a river, and he swam with
the strong current down the stream. He knew there were many Indians in a teepee village
near that river, and they would help him.
</p>
<p>Menabozho kept the moose head out of the water and made a great noise. He heard the
Indian boys whoop and knew they had seen him. The hunters got their canoes and came
out to him with their tomahawks, for they thought it was a moose and they would get
much fat meat.
</p>
<p>The Indians broke the moose head with their tomahawks and found Menabozho. He was
always good to the Indians, and many times he helped them in their hunting.
</p>
<p>“It is a good trick,” they all said; then Menabozho laughed, and they were glad to
see him.
</p>
<p>The chief made a great feast in his teepee. Menabozho told many stories, but he did
not tell how the wolves, the trees, and the moose head all played tricks on him.

<p>Menabozho had a wolf who hunted for him.
</p>
<p>“My brother,” said Menabozho, “never cross the water, for the water manitous will
catch you.”
</p>
<p>One day the wolf was tired and saw a narrow stream in his way, so he threw the goose
he had caught over his back and tried to leap across the stream. The water manitou
caught him, and Menabozho had no supper and never again saw his wolf.

<p>The next day Menabozho saw the kingfisher sitting on a tree near the stream.

<p>“My brother,” said Menabozho the Sly One, “can you tell me where Menabozho’s brother
wolf is?”
</p>
<p>“What will you give me if I tell you?” said the kingfisher.
</p>
<p>“I will put a fine collar around your neck if you will tell me,” said Menabozho.
</p>
<p>“First put the collar around my neck, then I will tell you,” said the bird.
</p>
<p>Menabozho fastened around the bird’s neck a beautiful white collar, which he wears
to this day; then the <span class="pageNum" id="pb236">[<a href="#pb236">236</a>]</span>kingfisher told him how he had seen the wolf caught while leaping across the water
the day before, and said:
</p>
<p>“The great water manitou comes out when the sun is hottest to rest on the shore. He
will sleep on the wolfskin. The mud turtle will sit on a stone and keep watch for
Menabozho. The bear will stand by this tree and watch. I will sit on this tree and
watch, too. We are all friends, but maybe you are Menabozho?”
</p>
<p>The bird jumped, but Menabozho caught its head in his hands. The kingfisher twisted
his head out of Menabozho’s fingers, gave a laugh, and flew away; and that is the
way he got his ruffle.

<p class="first">enabozho watched for the water manitou, and he stood just like a stump of a tree.
The bear which was watching for Menabozho did not see him. The mud turtle which was
watching did not know that he was the stump, so they went to sleep; then Menabozho
got back his wolfskin from under the manitou, and the manitou did not need it any
more.
</p>
<p>All the other water manitous gave chase after Menabozho to avenge their brother. He
called to a woodchuck to dig fast into a hill.
</p>
<p>Menabozho pulled into the hole all the dirt that the woodchuck threw out. The water
manitous found no hole in the hill, and Menabozho got away.
</p>
<p>Menabozho gave the woodchuck long claws and soft hair. He told him that the corn is
good. He called the woodchuck his brother because he helped to hide Menabozho from
the water manitous.

</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first center">(<span class="sc">Chippewa</span>, 1895)
</p>
<p>One day Menabozho went fishing with hook and line in Gitchee Gumee, the Big Sea Water.
A large fish came along and swallowed the hook and line, swallowed Menabozho and his
canoe, swallowed everything, just like a big sea cave.
</p>
<p>When Menabozho waked out of his sleep he saw a squirrel sitting on the canoe beside
him. The fish had swallowed him, too.
</p>
<p>Menabozho said: “Brother Squirrel, where are we?”
</p>
<p>The squirrel answered: “Menabozho, we are in a great fish.”
</p>
<p>Menabozho found his bow and arrows in the canoe and shot an arrow upward. It killed
the great fish. The body of the fish began to rise to the top of the water. Menabozho
prayed to the Great Manitou that the wind might blow from the south. The Great Spirit
heard his prayer and sent the south wind. It blew the great fish to the north shore
of Gitchee Gumee, where Nokomis lived.
<span class="pageNum" id="pb240">[<a href="#pb240">240</a>]</span></p>
<p>The great fish floated on the water like a little sun-fish; when it touched the shore
the birds fed on its flesh, and Menabozho came out and went to his grandmother, Nokomis.
</p>
<p>After their greeting was over Menabozho went back and found the birds still feeding
on the fish.
</p>
<p>“Go away, my little brothers,” he said.
</p>
<p>Each bird took a piece of the fish and flew away, and Menabozho then cut up the great
creature and made much fish oil; he had a great plan in his mind and was glad to have
this oil.
</p>
<p>A wicked manitou lived on an island in Gitchee Gumee. This island had miles of blackest
pitch on all of its shores; not even a water manitou could swim through this pitch.
Menabozho carried the fish oil over and poured it on the pitch; wherever the oil touched
the pitch it was never sticky again.
</p>
<p>Menabozho found the wigwam of the wicked manitou. All day long he shot arrows at this
wigwam. The manitou came out and laughed at him.
</p>
<p>A woodpecker called out, “Hit him in the back, Menabozho!”
</p>
<p>The manitou just then turned to run, and Menabozho hit him and he fell. The woodpecker
flew down by Menabozho. His white feathers were stained by the pitch, but Menabozho
painted his head with war paint. He is one of Menabozho’s brothers.

<p class="first">hat is thunder?” a white man asked a Sioux or Dakota Indian.
</p>
<p>“Thunder is a big bird flying in the air. It makes tracks like fire. You can hear
it clap its wings. It is the young thunder-birds that hurt the Sioux. The old birds
will not touch us. They are our friends.”
</p>
<p>“Did you ever see a thunder-bird?” was asked by the white man.
</p>
<p>“I never did, but my father’s brother, Little Crow, saw one fall dead out of the sky.
It had wings wide as a white man’s house, and it had lightning on its wings. It had
a face like a man; its nose was like an eagle’s bill.”
</p>
<p>“Who else ever saw one?” was the next question.
</p>
<p>“One fall our tribe was out hunting, and a thunder-bird flew down on the ground just
a little way from them. It did not hurt them; they saw that it had on <span class="pageNum" id="pb242">[<a href="#pb242">242</a>]</span>snowshoes. They found the track of the shoes when it flew away. Our tribe had good
hunting that winter. They killed many bears.”
</p>
<p>“We have only one God; why do you have so many?” was next asked.
</p>
<p>“The Great Spirit is the god of the Dakotas,” said the Indian. “He made everything
but wild rice and thunder. We must do as our fathers have done or the spirits of the
dead will punish us. It is not good to change. We believe what they told us when we
were children. We worship the Great Spirit.”
</p>
<p>“Who rules the water?” asked the white man.
</p>
<p>“Unktahe, the spirit of the water.”
</p>
<p>“What do you call the thunder?”
</p>
<p>“Wahkeon. He and Unktahe are always fighting. It is a great battle; when there is
a storm Unktahe sends the thunder-birds back to the sky, sometimes.”
</p>
<p>“Tell me more about the thunder-birds,” said the white man.
</p>
<p>“Wahkeontonka is the father of all the birds. He is Big Thunder. He lives on a great
mountain in the west. His wigwam has four doors. A caribou stands at the north door.
He is swift like the north wind. At the south door is a red deer; he is very beautiful.
His eyes are like the little lakes in summer.
</p>
<p>“A butterfly watches at the east door of the wigwam. He is like the morning light.
A bear watches <span class="pageNum" id="pb243">[<a href="#pb243">243</a>]</span>the west door, and when the wind blows from the west even the white people can hear
the bear growling. This is true.”
</p>
<p>“What has Wahkeontonka done for the Indian?”
</p>
<p>“The thunder spirit gave the Indians thunder and wild rice. They eat rice and are
strong. He showed them how to use the bow and arrow.
</p>
<p>“He dug iron from the ground and made tomahawks. He made spears. The Indians know
Wahkeontonka is wise.”
</p>
<p>The Dakotas believe that their god of storm lives on Thunder Cap, a high promontory
in Minnesota overlooking Lake Superior; from here he sends the rain, hail, or snow.
</p>
<p>Thunder Bay lies at his feet; on its shore lies the great giant turned to stone, who,
ages ago, dared to defy Big Thunder. Wahkeontonka is the Dakotas’ Jupiter.

<h2 class="sub"><span class="sc">How he united the Five Nations</span></h2>

<div class="divBody">
<div class="figure floatLeft"><img src="images/im244.png" alt="M" width="190" height="328"></div>
<p class="first">any, many moons ago three Indians sat on the bank of the great river with many islands.
These three Indians had come on a long trail from their country, and it was a new
trail, for they had made it themselves. Nobody had been on it before they cut their
way through the thick forest.
</p>
<p>The fathers of these Indians had been told of this river in the north which was filled
with islands. The three Indians had said to their fathers that they would seek it;
now they sat on a little hill, and it was before them.
</p>
<p>The night sun had changed into a shape like a canoe three times since they had started
on the long trail. Their moccasins were torn, and their feet were very tired; but
the river was very beautiful, and it made their eyes glad to see it.
</p>
<p>While the three Indians sat watching the river, they saw a white canoe coming straight
toward the little hill <span class="pageNum" id="pb245">[<a href="#pb245">245</a>]</span>where they sat. It seemed to come from the place of the setting sun.
</p>
<p>The three Indians saw a white-haired chief alone in the canoe, and he had no paddle.
The canoe came very fast, but it needed no help. The white-haired chief told the canoe
to stop by the little hill on the shore where sat the three Indians; it came there
and stopped.
</p>
<p>The three Indians knew by the strange canoe that the Great Spirit had sent him, and
they were afraid.
</p>
<p>The white-haired chief said: “I am Hiawatha. I will help you and your people. Tell
me what your nation can do. Tell me of your hunting.”
</p>
<p>The three arose and told Hiawatha of their nation. They had thought their people very
strong; now they seemed like wild rabbits for weakness. They told him of their hunting,
but they were not proud, for Hiawatha was wiser than any chief, and he knew what was
in their hearts.
</p>
<p>Hiawatha said: “Go back to your people. I shall come, and you will see me when you
have made my lodge ready. I knew you were coming, for I saw you in the dark forests.
I saw you on the great rocks in the forests. Go back and tell your people I am coming.
Tell them to make a wigwam for Hiawatha.”
</p>
<p>The three Indians could not talk to each other. Their hearts were full. They found
the trail they had made and followed it back to their own land; there <span class="pageNum" id="pb246">[<a href="#pb246">246</a>]</span>they told their chiefs of the wise one in the white canoe. The chiefs made ready for
his coming.
</p>
<p>“He will come in a white stone canoe,” said the chiefs.
</p>
<p>The wigwam was built by a lake, and it was made of the finest skins of the deer. It
was a white wigwam, with the door left open. No one watched to see who should shut
the door.
</p>
<p>One morning the door was shut, and a strange white canoe was in the water. The people
came out of their lodges, and soon the doorway of skins in the white wigwam was opened.
Hiawatha had come to the Onondaga nation. His wigwam was on the shore of Tiota or
Cross Lake, in the land of the Onondagas.
</p>
<p>Heyanwatha means the Wise Man. Hiawatha the people call him now. He taught the Onondagas
many things, for he had lived with the Great Spirit. He was sent to help the Indian
tribes.
</p>
<p>Hiawatha taught the people how to plant corn and beans. They learned much about planting,
and they learned how to store food for winter time.
</p>
<p>While he was with the Onondagas the runners brought word that a great band of warriors
was coming to fight them. The young braves put on their war paint.
</p>
<p>“Call a great council of all the tribes,” said the wise Hiawatha. “Let them meet on
the hill by the lake.” It was Onondaga Lake.
<span class="pageNum" id="pb247">[<a href="#pb247">247</a>]</span></p>
<p>Swift runners carried word to four tribes. Their chiefs and great braves met on the
hill by the lake, and their wives waited with them. All the people waited for three
days, but Hiawatha did not come to the council. The chiefs sent men to Hiawatha on
the morning of the fourth day to ask why he made them wait.
</p>
<p>Hiawatha answered: “The Holder of the Heavens has shown me that if I go to this council
great sorrow will come to me. I was sent to teach you peace. I shall show you how
to make war. I will come.”
</p>
<p>Then Hiawatha stepped into his white stone canoe, and it went to the place of the
great council, where the chiefs waited.
</p>
<p>All the great chiefs and the people shouted when Hiawatha came. He stood still in
the council circle. His daughter stood beside him, but no one had seen her before.
When her father looked at her she went to her place among the women.
</p>
<p>The first day of the council the chiefs told their plans, and Hiawatha listened. The
second day he arose in the council, and the people listened. Hiawatha said wise words.
All the chiefs remembered the words of Hiawatha. He made this speech:
</p>
<p>“My brothers: You are from many tribes. You have come here for one cause. It is to
live in safety. We must join ourselves together. The tribes that are <span class="pageNum" id="pb248">[<a href="#pb248">248</a>]</span>on the warpath are strong. Not one tribe here is equal to that great people. Make
yourselves a band of brothers. Then you will be stronger than they.
</p>
<p>“The Mohawks that sit in council by that great tree shall be the first nation. They
are the warlike people.
</p>
<p>“The Oneidas who sit by the great stone that cannot be moved shall be the second nation.
They are a wise people.
</p>
<p>“The Onondagas that live at the foot of the great hills shall be the third nation.
They are great in speech making.
</p>
<p>“The Senecas who live in the forest, and whose trails are found all over the land,
shall be the fourth nation, for they have much wisdom in hunting.
</p>
<p>“The Cayugas live in the open country. Their wigwams are the finest, and their beans
and corn grow like the grass on the plains. Their name is known for great wisdom;
they shall be the fifth nation.”
</p>
<p>Hiawatha sat down in the council, and the third day the chiefs talked with one another;
then they all said: “We will do this thing. We will be one nation. We will be called
the Five Nations.”
</p>
<p>The council was ended. Hiawatha went to his canoe and called softly to his daughter.
</p>
<p>As she left the women a great cloud came in the sky. It was a thunder-bird. The great
cloud took the daughter of Hiawatha, and she was gone.
<span class="pageNum" id="pb249">[<a href="#pb249">249</a>]</span></p>
<p></p>

</div><p>
<span class="pageNum" id="pb250">[<a href="#pb250">250</a>]</span></p>
<p>The white stone canoe came to the landing place. There was music in the air like the
wind blowing through the pine trees. All the sky was filled with the sweet music.
</p>
<p>The people mourned for Hiawatha, for he was gone. His wigwam by the lake Tiota was
empty, and he was never seen again.
</p>
<p>The Five Nations say that he went to the Islands of the Happy Ones. Owayneo, the Great
Spirit, called him. His daughter had gone before him.
</p>
<p>The Five Nations were strong. They were a wise people. Many moons after the white
men came the Tuscaroras sat with them around the council-fire. Then they were known
as the Six Nations. The white people have often called them the Mingos.

<p class="first">iawatha was on his way to the country of the Mohawks. He went from one nation to another
to teach them the things they needed to know. While on his journey he came to the
borders of a lake. It was too deep to wade across, and he stood still thinking whether
he should call his magic white canoe to help him or go back. He had come on a long
trail and was very tired.
</p>
<p>While he was wondering which way was best, the sky was filled with wild ducks. These
birds flew down upon the lake and began to drink and to swim. In a few minutes they
flew up into the air again, in one great black flock.
</p>
<p>Behold! the lake was dry, and its bed was a mass of shells.
</p>
<p>Hiawatha knew that the lake had been made dry ground for his sake. He gathered some
of the shells <span class="pageNum" id="pb252">[<a href="#pb252">252</a>]</span>and, striking them with sharp flints, strung the pieces on strings of sinew. This
was the first wampum.
</p>
<p>He carried the strings of wampum to the Mohawks, and they believe their tribe to have
been the first to use it.
</p>
<p>They showed the other tribes how to make the long strings of bead money, and many
bands went on strange trails to find the rivers or the lakes where the shells were
hidden under the water.
</p>
<p>Mounds like small hills have been found by the white men near lakes and streams. When
these mounds were uncovered, it was known that they were only heaps of broken shells.
The flint stones were not good tools, and the Indians would use only perfect beads.

<p class="first">n old teepee stood by a frozen river in the forest where there are many pine trees.
The tops of the trees were white with snow. The teepee was almost covered with the
snow. An old chief sat in this teepee; his hair was like the icicles that hang from
dead pine-tree branches; he was very old.
</p>
<p>He was covered with furs. The floor of his teepee was covered with the skins of the
bear and the elk. He had been a great hunter. His name was Peboan. Peboan was faint
with hunger, and he was cold. He had been hunting for three days. He had killed nothing.
All the moose, deer, and bear had gone. They had left no trail. Wabasso, the rabbit,
had hidden in the bushes. There was no food, no meat for Peboan.
</p>
<p>He called upon the great Menabozho for help.
</p>
<p>“Come, Menabozho, come help Peboan, the chief of the winter manitous. Come, for Mukwa
the bear has gone from me. Come, or Peboan must go to the far <span class="pageNum" id="pb254">[<a href="#pb254">254</a>]</span>north to find Mahto the white bear. Peboan is old, and his feet are weary.”
</p>
<p>Peboan crawled on his knees over the furs to the little fire in the middle of the
teepee. He blew on the coals with his faint breath, and the coals grew very red. His
breath was like a wind; the coals made the wind warm like a south wind. The deerskins
that covered the teepee trembled like leaves, for the warm wind blew them.
</p>
<p>Peboan sat on the furs on the floor of his teepee and waited. He knew Menabozho would
hear him.
</p>
<p>Peboan heard no sound, but he looked toward the door of his teepee. It was lifted
back, and he saw a beautiful Indian maiden.
</p>
<p>She carried a great bundle of willow buds in her arms. Her dress was of sweet grass
and early maple leaves. Her eyes were like a young deer. Her hair was like the blackest
feathers of a crow, and it was so long that it was like a blanket over her shoulders.
She was small; her feet were hidden in two moccasin flowers.
</p>
<p>“Menabozho heard Peboan, the winter manitou. He has sent me. I am Segun.”
</p>
<p>“You are welcome, Segun. Sit by my fire; it is warm. I have no meat. Sit down and
tell me what you can do.”
</p>
<p>“Peboan may tell first what he can do,” said Segun.
<span class="pageNum" id="pb255">[<a href="#pb255">255</a>]</span></p>
<p>Peboan said: “I am a winter manitou; I blow my breath, and the flowers die. The waters
stand still; the leaves fall and die.”
</p>
<p>Segun said: “I am a summer manitou; I blow my breath, and the flowers open their eyes.
The waters follow me on my trail.”
</p>
<p>Peboan said: “I shake my hair, and the snow falls on the mountains, like the feathers
of Waubese, the great white swan.”
</p>
<p>Segun said: “I shake my hair, and warm rain falls from the clouds. I call, and the
birds answer me. The trees put on their leaves, and the grass grows thick like the
fur of the bear. The summer sky is my teepee. Menabozho has said that the time has
come for you to go.”
</p>
<p>Peboan’s head bent over on his shoulder. The sun melted the snow on the pine trees;
it melted the snow on the teepee. Segun waved her hands over Peboan, and a strange
thing happened.
</p>
<p>Peboan grew smaller and smaller. His deerskin clothes turned to leaves and covered
Peboan on the ground.
</p>
<p>Segun looked, but Peboan was gone. She took some flowers from her hair and hid them
under the leaves on the ground. There was ice on the leaves, but it did not hurt the
pink flowers. Segun breathed on the flowers, and they became sweet.
<span class="pageNum" id="pb256">[<a href="#pb256">256</a>]</span></p>
<p>She said: “I go, but the flowers shall stay to tell of Segun’s visit to Peboan. The
children shall find them and know that Segun has sent Peboan away. It shall be so
each time the snows melt and the rivers begin to run. This flower shall tell that
spring has come.”
</p>
<p>Peboan’s teepee was sweet with the breath of the flowers, but Segun was gone.

Hunting Grounds. His squaw shed many tears when he told her. His children wailed loudly,
for they knew no one ever returned from that journey.
</p>
<p>“We will follow you on the long trail,” said his squaw.
</p>
<p>The warrior hid his arrows and his bow, put on the new moccasins that lay by his wigwam
door, and started. Behind him followed in the same trail his squaw, his sons, and
his dog. He sang the death chant, and their voices echoed the chant. The dog knew
its meaning and howled for sorrow.

did not look back, but his squaw called to him: “I am here. I am strong. I will follow
you to the gate of the Happy Hunting Grounds.”
</p>
<p>Then the trail became rough and steep. The wild cactus tore their moccasins. The thorn
tree caught their blankets and tore their flesh.
</p>
<p>The wife was weary and cried: “Let us rest. Let us wait.” She fell on her face in
the trail.
</p>
<p>When she arose no one was before her. She said: “I will go and find our children;
then I will come back to the trail and find my husband.”
</p>
<p>The warrior was now alone. No, not alone, for his dog, footsore and heated with the
long journey, kept at his heels. His master had not known that he had followed. Now
in the dark night his dog pressed his head against him to comfort him.
</p>
<p>The trail led westward, but the morning sun cast no long shadows of the wife and children.
They had not taken up the trail again.
</p>
<p>And still forever toward the west went the two, the Indian and his dog. Moons and
suns rose and set. At last, across the wide plains, he saw two great rocks, like tall
trees. These marked the gateway of the Happy Hunting Grounds. Tired, sick, and nearly
fainting with weariness, the Indian kept on his way. <span class="pageNum" id="pb259">[<a href="#pb259">259</a>]</span>Tired, hungry, and very weak, behind him came the faithful dog.
</p>
<p>At the gateway the Indian raised his voice and cried: “I am here. The Great Spirit
called me; I have come.”
</p>
<p>The watchman opened the gate and, taking the brave by the hand, led him past the two
great rocks that held the wonderful gate.
</p>
<p>“Where are those who were with you at the first?” asked the watchman.
</p>
<p>“The way was long. Their feet were weary,” was the answer.
</p>
<p>“Who is this that stands watching you, with eyes that show the tears they cannot shed?”
</p>
<p>“He who loved me best,” said the Indian.
</p>
<p>The watchman put his hand on the head of the hound. The dog gave a joyful leap, and
the gates of the Happy Hunting Grounds shut both the Indian and his dog into the Land
of Rest, from which there is no return.

</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first center">(<span class="sc">Micmac</span>)
</p>
<p>A white rabbit ran away from town. He was afraid of the dogs, and the children pulled
his ears. He found it was better to live among the animals in the woods, but he did
not like to say so to them. He was always telling of the fine things he had left.
</p>
<p>The wild rabbit is gray. The white rabbit said no one wore gray in town. The best
people had white clothes and very fine; that was why his fur was so soft and like
the snow.
</p>
<p>“Ours was the best family in town,” the white rabbit would say very often.
</p>
<p>The marten is small and brown. His fur is worn by the best people, and he knows they
think much of him. He could not understand why the white rabbit should think himself
any better than a marten.
</p>
<p>He met the white rabbit in the woods one day. They had a long talk, and the rabbit
invited him to come to his heap of little dry bushes and eat dinner with him. He would
answer any questions the marten would ask, because those who come out of a town always
know a great deal. It is kind to tell what you know.
<span class="pageNum" id="pb261">[<a href="#pb261">261</a>]</span></p>
<p></p>
<div class="figure p261width" id="p261"><img src="images/p261.jpg" alt="Adobe Houses. Pueblo Children near Kiva" width="693" height="497"><p class="figureHead"><span class="sc">Adobe Houses. Pueblo Children near Kiva</span></p>

</div><p>
<span class="pageNum" id="pb262">[<a href="#pb262">262</a>]</span></p>
<p>The marten was seen by the gray rabbits to brush his fur and wash his face and paws
very carefully. They watched him go into the white rabbit’s brush heap. The gray rabbits
put their ears very far back and ran away. “The marten is wise, but he will know more
when he comes home,” said the ones in gray.
</p>
<p>The marten ate with the white rabbit. He thought they ate too fast, but it was not
polite to say so. He tried to eat like the rabbit and watched his mouth. After a time
the marten began his questions.
</p>
<p>“What makes the slit in your lip?” asked the visitor.
</p>
<p>“My family in town all ate with knives and forks. My knife slipped and cut my lip,”
was the answer.
</p>
<p>“What makes you keep moving your mouth and whiskers?”
</p>
<p>“Because I am always planning and worrying. My family always worried. We do not think
enough about what might happen out here in the country. Perhaps a great fire might
come and burn up all these trees; perhaps the river may come and drown us. The birds
make us forget these things. We are too happy.”
</p>
<p>The marten shook his head, but he said some grass had touched his nose. He did not
want the rabbit to think him different from town people.
</p>
<p>The two went out to walk under the trees.
</p>
<p>“What makes you hop?” asked the marten.
<span class="pageNum" id="pb263">[<a href="#pb263">263</a>]</span></p>
<p>“My family always hop. People in town never step along like country people. See how
well I look and how clumsy that moose cow is over there.”
</p>
<p>Just then they heard a soft step on the brown pine needles; the marten flattened himself
down on the ground, and his brown fur could not be seen. The white rabbit ran away
with great jumps. He hid in the bushes.
</p>
<p>The two animals met again that day. “Why did you run so fast?” asked the marten.
</p>
<p>“I used to run races when I was in town. The boys and the dogs all played with me.
Every one goes fast when in town. I forgot how slow the country people are.”
</p>
<p>The marten walked and ran by the rabbit’s side.
</p>
<p>“Why is it that your tail is so short and your ears are so long?” he asked.
</p>
<p>“Every one in town wears something on his head. I wanted to be like the rest, and
now I have long ears; but I have only a little ball of fur for a tail. It is all that
was left when my ears were done.”
</p>
<p>The marten ran to the tallest pine tree. He climbed up where he could see the white
rabbit and then he screamed, “I do not believe one word!”
</p>
<p>The little gray rabbits heard him and laughed with the squirrels.

<p class="first"> long time ago the only place where light could be seen was in the teepee of one old
chief.
</p>
<p>This chief had light, fire, and water. All the other Indians in the whole world suffered
from cold and darkness and had no water.
</p>
<p>All the Indians came to this old chief’s teepee and begged for a little light. He
would not give them any. The Indians went away and told the wild animals, and asked
their help.
</p>
<p>The animals and the Indians held a great dance around the old chief’s teepee. They
chanted songs and all begged for light. Each one sang his own song.
</p>
<p>One young fox kept singing, “Khaih! Khaih!” which means “light.” He believed it would
bring light, and the men and the animals were helped, he was so strong. Their voices
made a great noise.
</p>
<p>At last a faint color was seen in the east. The old chief came out and drove the little
light away.
<span class="pageNum" id="pb265">[<a href="#pb265">265</a>]</span></p>
<p>Then the young fox called, “Khaih! Khaih!” louder than before. The men and the animals
began again. They called and called for the light to come.
</p>
<p>At last a little color was seen in the east again. The old chief had not slept. He
was tired and he said: “You may have all the light you want.”
</p>
<p>Now the light comes every morning. Some of the animals still call for it to come before
it is day.
</p>
<p>A young caribou said that he would get the fire from the old chief’s teepee. The Indians
tied a great dry branch to his big antlers. The young caribou put his head into the
fire teepee and tried to reach the coals, but he could not do it. The wise chief drove
him away.
</p>
<p>But when the old chief was driving back the young caribou, a muskrat crept into the
teepee. He reached the precious coals of fire and caught one in his mouth. He ran
back into the woods with it. Before he could reach his own burrow he had to drop the
burning coal. It fell on the dry leaves and set the woods on fire. You can see now
where the muskrat burned himself.
</p>
<p>All the world had fire now, and there has always been enough since the muskrat dropped
the first coal.
</p>
<p>The fire melted the ice in the rivers and lakes. The light showed every one where
to find water.
</p>
<p>The old chief has never been seen since that time.

</div>
<div class="divBody">

</p>
<div class="figure floatLeft"><img src="images/it266.png" alt="T" width="222" height="240"></div>
<p class="first">here is a noble priest who has long been a missionary among the Portage Indians, near
the Lake of the Woods. He has won their respect, given them a written language, and
taught them many of the white man’s secrets; in return they have told him many of
their stories and their secrets. They have told him why they no longer own copper
mines, but must get copper from the Kaidahs, a stronger tribe.
</p>
<p>This is the story:
</p>
<p class="tb"></p><p>
</p>
<p>Many moons ago the Indians living about Hudson Bay all went to a certain place in
the west for their copper.
</p>
<p>A great mountain of copper stood there, and it was in the middle of the water. The
Portage Indians tell that each tribe wanted the mountain; at last, when many tribes
were working together to get out the <span class="pageNum" id="pb267">[<a href="#pb267">267</a>]</span>copper, it was agreed to let one tribe own it; but which tribe? No one could tell.
</p>
<p>It was left for the copper mountain itself to decide who should be its master. All
the tribes began to shout for it to come to them. The mountain did not move for a
long time.
</p>
<p>At last it trembled; then the Kaidah Indians, who have big heads and loud voices,
shouted louder than any other tribe. The top of the mountain fell toward the Kaidahs.
</p>
<p>“And that is why we go and trade with them for the copper with which to make the rings
we give our women and children,” say the Portage or Carrier Indians of Manitoba.

<p class="first">he Day Sun has a twin brother that is white. He is not a strong warrior like the Day
Sun, who is as red as war paint. The Day Sun can make an Indian fall down in the hot
days of summer. The Indian is made weak by the arrows the Day Sun makes in the summer
morning. Sometimes he lets you see these arrows. They are very long. They are around
his head like the war bonnet of a very great chief.
</p>
<p>The Night Sun is cold and cannot hurt even an owl. He has to do all the things his
twin brother tells him to do. He is not strong, and he breaks to pieces trying to
do so much. He hides his face and tries to go away, but he always comes back and is
glad to start again.
</p>
<p>The strong Day Sun comes every morning from the wigwam of Hannanna the Morning Light.
This wigwam is made of the smoke of burning rivers. You can see this smoke go up from
the water if you will sit still and watch. The Day Sun can burn up a little <span class="pageNum" id="pb269">[<a href="#pb269">269</a>]</span>river. He paints the smoke of the rivers with rainbows that have come and gone. They
are saved to make the Place of the Morning Light so beautiful that men will watch
for the coming of the Day Sun.
</p>
<p>All the animals and the birds call to Hannanna in the morning to open the door of
his wigwam and let the red light come. There is no war paint on the land that is as
red as the Day Sun. When Hannanna has his wigwam by the water you can see more than
when it is over the land. The Day Sun is happy by the water.
</p>
<p>When the red warrior of the sky goes out of sight in the west he rides in a canoe
behind the trees and hills to his place in the east. On his way he talks to the Night
Sun. You cannot see the canoe of the Day Sun.
</p>
<p>The Night Sun does not care if men see that he rides in a canoe like an Indian. He
comes from the White Land in the east. He walks over the Bridge of Stars, the pathway
of the spirits. The Night Sun helps the spirits that walk on this path to the happy
Summer Land. He does much good.
</p>
<p>The Day Sun makes the corn grow. He makes all the seeds and the trees grow when it
is summer. The Night Sun has to take care of them when he is gone.
</p>
<p>The Indians dance the sun dance when the Night Sun is round and white. He looks at
the Indians and tells his brother of the dance. The Day Sun is glad to know that the
Indians give thanks for his gifts to them.

<p class="first">he red man remembers the brave paleface as well as the warrior of his own race and
color.
</p>
<p>The wild charge of Custer and his men and their utter defeat will be often told and
retold in the wigwams of the tribes who fought him.
</p>
<p>The Indians claim that the strange plant that is now found on the Custer battle ground
has been created by some spirit which knew of the mighty courage of the white brave
with yellow hair.
</p>
<p>This plant is called Custer’s Heart. It has long, slender leaves curved exactly like
a saber; the edges of these leaves are so sharp that they cut the hand that attempts
to tear them from the plant.
</p>
<p>If you touch the plant you will feel a chill, for each leaf is cold. The blossoms
come in the hot summer days. The flowers are heart-shaped and yellow as gold, with
a center of scarlet that looks like a drop of blood.
</p>
<p>But whoever plucks the flower must hold it gently, for if it should be crushed, the
scarlet stain, the Indians claim, could never be washed away.
<span class="pageNum" id="pb271">[<a href="#pb271">271</a>]</span></p>
<p>It may be that this flower is known only in the dreams of Indian braves, but the new
legend shows how the memory of the brave general lives in the hearts of his red enemies.
It shows that it is always in the heart of man to admire the brave deeds of another,
even though the hero is an enemy.
</p>
<p>This story tells us also that there are those among the red men who, while they may
be dressed in paint, buckskin, and blankets, have thoughts like those expressed by
the white man’s poets.
